Some Marketplaces, including B2W, identify the **EAN **data item, which is the product bar code, as mandatory for integration on their platform.

Validation is done using the check digit, and in the event it is not valid, this prevents the integration of the product. 

To ensure EANs are correct, you need to reach out to their suppliers and manufacturers for the information for each product to be integrated on the marketplaces.

_VTEX does not generate false or joker EANs to supply this scenario._
