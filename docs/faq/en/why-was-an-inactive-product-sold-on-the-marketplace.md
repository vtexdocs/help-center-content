This can happen because [it is impossible to deactivate an item in the marketplace](/en/faq/why-isnt-my-product-deactivated-on-the-marketplace), because this process is not part of the integration. In other words, deactivation can only be done in VTEX.

For an SKU to be inactive with a partner, this has to be configured in the marketplace, and you must contact them direct.

If a purchase has been made, you can accept it, activating the item for the order to be integrated, or refuse integration.
