When uploading a freight spreadsheet, you may encounter the "*Object reference not set to an instance of an object*" error.

This error occurs when a __column title of the freight spreadsheet__ is written down with an incorrect name.

To solve the problem, it is necessary to adjust the title of the column to the correct name and upload the spreadsheet again.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
In case the spreadsheet is over 10 MB, you’ll need to compact it in .zip format. The .zip archive should have less than 10 MB. Otherwise, the upload won’t work.
