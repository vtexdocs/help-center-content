At VTEX, we share the responsibility of our clients' success. Our support plans give you access to the best level of assistance and expertise to use the platform better and develop your business. You can mitigate risks associated with your digital operation and keep operational costs under control. 

## Support

All clients have access to the services provided by our Support team. These specialists are extensively prepared to give you the best experience possible when solving your tickets. To contact them, you need to [open a ticket to VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/abrir-chamados-para-o-suporte-vtex--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM?locale=pt).

### Ticket System

The official communications channel with the Support team is established through the ticket system. To open a ticket, access the Help Center homepage and click on the **Support** option in the top bar.  

The moment you open a ticket, it is directed to the support team responsible for that store, team which will respond as soon as possible. Clients receive their ticket replies by email. 

While waiting for your ticket to be solved, you may follow its status using [the support panel](https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests). When a ticket is marked as solved, you will receive a feedback email to indicate your level of satisfaction and include any comments related to our service.

### Support Plans

To better serve global customers in different countries, our Customer Excellence team works independently by region. Each region has the autonomy to define its team organization, availability, service SLA and additional support resources:

- Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- [Brazil](/pt/faq/suporte-vtex-brasil--5q861sTw1n7H2BENOu7ls9)
- [United States (USA)](/en/faq/vtex-support-united-states--Bm45YFp68QRe1Z5r2oa07)
- Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)
- Latin America (LATAM, ex. Brasil)

### Satisfaction Survey

The *Satisfaction Survey* page in your VTEX Admin allows you to view a list of resolved tickets submitted by you on behalf of your store. Through the page you can also rate VTEX's support through our Satisfaction Survey page after each ticket is resolved.    

To access it, go to **Account settings** and click on **Satisfaction survey**.

## Services available to any plan

### Real-time Monitoring

We value transparency regarding the integrity of our systems. Thus, whenever there is a critical problem that can affect store sales or the functioning of the platform, we will establish a proactive communication with clients and partners through the following three channels:  

- The [Healthcheck](http://healthcheck.vtex.com/) dashboard shows modules responsible for monitoring each VTEX service in real time. We display a functioning indicator for each module and the time it was last updated, warning when a resource is unavailable or not functioning properly. 

- The [Status](https://status.vtex.com/) page displays a timeline with the recent system incidents history. Detailed information on each incident is available, such as what happened, which modules were affected, the sequence of actions taken towards solving the problem, and in the end, a summary of the issue. 

- The [Releases](https://releases.vtex.com/) page displays a timeline, detailed per module and version, with all updates made in stable and beta environments. 

We will take all necessary measures to solve any issue as soon as possible and fulfill our [SLA](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-o-sla-de-operacao-da-plataforma--2cIFrsY5S8usk84OU4QOKm?locale=pt) under contract.

### Help Center

This [documentation portal for users](https://help.vtex.com) contains beginner tutorials, reference guides and troubleshooting articles. It has all the information needed for you to use the VTEX Admin panel.   

### Developer Portal

The [developer portal](https://developers.vtex.com) contains all the documentation on API integrations and development guides for your store. The target audience for this content are our [partners](https://vtex.com/br-pt/partner/) and our client's developer teams. 

### Announcements

Our admin panel contains a product update communications channel, which highlights our latest functionalities and releases, in addition to any necessary action to avoid downtime. These announcements are also available in the Help Center [News](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements) section. 

Technical updates focused on developers and partners, including APIs updates, new development guides and VTEX IO announcements, are published in the Developer Portal [Release Notes](https://developers.vtex.com/changelog) section.  

Releases that are highly relevant to the market, such as new products, impactful new resources for existing products and company updates, are published on the [Blog](https://vtex.com/pt-br/category/produto/) and in the product's monthly newsletter.  

## Additional services on demand

For situations in which our clients need greater support for more complex projects, we offer project consulting services. If you are interested, your Customer Success Manager can guide you through all the available options and forward this request internally to the responsible teams.
