Installing an app means fetching it from the __vendor__'s Registry and making it usable in your workspace.

For example, if you want to use the Visa Checkout app in your store, you need to install it first in a development [workspace](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-is-a-workspace).
__UPDATE__: We now allow users to install apps in __master workspace__. Be careful since you will be changing the __production environment__.

A user can install any app [published](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-does-publishing-an-app-mean) with [pricing options](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/app-pricing-options) or any VTEX native app (with `vtex` as __vendor__).


In order to install a paid app, the user must have the necessary permission in [License Manager](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/overview-of-the-license-manager).
