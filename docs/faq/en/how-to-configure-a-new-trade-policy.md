The [trade policy](/en/tutorial/configuring-a-marketplace-trade-policy) is used for differentiating __catalogs, prices and/or logistics__ between the store’s different sales channels, including the marketplaces.

In other words, a new trade policy is only required when one of the above factors is different among the sales channels, making it necessary to create a new trade policy.

Let's say, for example, that you have a substore specific for B2B sales and you wish to offer a product assortment that is different from the one you offer in your main store. In that case, you may create two trade policies: one that will be linked to the main store and another one that will be linked to the B2B substore.

To add more trade policies, you have to get in touch with the Sales Operations area at: __sales-operations@vtex.com__.

Adding trade policies that are linked to certified marketplaces or other VTEX stores is free of monthly fees.
