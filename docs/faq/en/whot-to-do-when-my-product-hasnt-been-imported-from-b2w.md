Normally, an order placed on B2W must be indexed in SkyHub, and then placed in the queue. This process usually takes **up to 1 hour**. Since VTEX constantly consumes this queue, orders do not accumulate. As they enter, they are distributed to each store.

But what do you do if a long period of time has elapsed and you can’t find the order on VTEX, even when searching via API? In this case, the best solution is to get in touch with Skyhub and ask it to check if the order was included in the queue.
