“Duplicated name” means that the same information is being shown twice, for example: _Porta Canetas - Porta Caneta Azul._

This effect is caused by an error in the product/SKU register. See below a detailed explanation about this problem and how to fix it.

Based on the product above, see the following example:

When the SKU name is identical to the Product name, the system does not display the SKU name on the product details page.

- **Product name:** Porta Caneta**s**
- **SKU Name:** Porta Caneta
- The system will show: Porta Caneta**s** - Porta Caneta

The words “Caneta**s**” and “Caneta”, which are respectively the product name and the SKU name, are diferente.
For this reason, both names are displayed.

### How to fix it

To fix it, just use exactly the same words for the product and the SKU:

- If the **Product Name **is: Porta Canetas
- and the **SKU Name **is: Porta Canetas
- The system will show: Porta Canetas

Or use only the product name complement in the SKU name:

- If the **Product Name** is: Porta Canetas
- and the **SKU Name** is: Azul
- The system will show: Porta Canetas - Azul
