The **Dashboard** is one of the new features included in the SmartCheckout version. It allows you to follow, in real time, charts and data regarding network performance and your store’s loading time, thus providing for a better monitoring of the data regarding your store, as well as a faster diagnosis of potential performance problems.

To access the Dashboard, click on the **License Manager** in the top menu of the SmartCheckout version and, then, click on **Dashboard.**

## Chart 1

The Dashboard includes 3 charts. In the first chart, you can compare the average loading time of your store (in red) to the average loading time of all other VTEX stores (in blue). See below an example of this chart.

Based on this chart, you can notice if a slowness in the system is affecting only your store or all VTEX stores. You will also be able to view whether a potential peak in loading time still persists or if it was just momentary. _It is _also_ important to mention that peaks do not necessarily mean a problem, _since the chart naturally reflects the behavior of your customers and a greater number of accesses at certain times of the day. As time goes by, you will get used to the behavior of your store and be able to distinguish uncommon behaviors.

## Chart 2

In the second chart, you can also view your store’s average loading time, but, this time, it will be divided in the different factors that make up a webpage uploading time: network time (in blue), DOM tree processing (in red) and page rendering in the browser (yellow).

You will be able to distinguish whether a delay in page loading is being caused, for example, by a delay in response from server (NetworkTime), an error in JavaScript (DomProcessing), or a heavy image (PageRendering).

## Chart 3

The third chart is identical to the second one. However, instead of measuring your store’s loading time, it displays the average loading time of all VTEX stores. So, you are able to analyze whether the scenario relates to all stores or only to your store.

After all, the VTEX eCommerce Suite Dashboard improves the transparency of services provided by VTEX, being an additional tool for you to make a diagnosis of your problems, since it is known that the loading time has a great impact on conversion rates.
