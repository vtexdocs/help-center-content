A sales policy serves solely to define the range of products and the logistics to be applied in the marketplace.

For the range of products, you must associate with the commercial policy a collection containing the categories or group of SKUs to be sold by the partner.

And for logistics policies, in the logistics module, you must use the docks already arranged for transportation companies and stocks, or create a new one just for partners’ orders.

This being so, if you are going to use the same products and the same logistics as for an existing sales policy, just enter this ID in the marketplace configuration.
