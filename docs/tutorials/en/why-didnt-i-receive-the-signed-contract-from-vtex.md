If you did not receive the signed contract, it's because you have given us an automatic acceptance in our Adhesion Agreement. Upon receiving your request to hire our service, we understand that you have read the commercial terms contained in it and accepted our terms.

After this step, we automatically start the financial processes so that your store can join the platform.

If you have any questions about the validation of this document, you can access it and present it to your legal department at any time. Your Adhesion Agreement is available for consultation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6PmWThz9TZZZkt4M1QxZXVPdXc/view).
