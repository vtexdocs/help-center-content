After setting up the [order recurrence](/en/tutorial/configuring-recurrent-orders) in your store Admin, it's important to properly fill in the recurrence-related fields to ensure that it works as expected.

To better understand the meaning of each field of recurring orders, see the full description of related items on the page.

__Key name:__ in recurrence, the key is the __time period__ that involves the delivery of the product. The ideal scenario is to fill in the field with a *label* that has this idea and is easily identified by the customer of your store. __Ex.: Period, Range, Frequency .__

__Maximum Characters:__ in the case of recurrence, __this field does not have to be filled.__ Since the key is time related, it's not necessary to specify the number of characters. __It's important that you leave this field blank to avoid possible mistakes.__

__Values allowed:__ for the recurrence, the values refer to the frequency with which an order must be delivered. To avoid possible errors, the values should respect this structure: __Dayly, Weekly, Fortnightly, Monthly, Bimonthly, Quarterly, Half Yearly and Annual.__ If you wish, you can include all values in the field, __just don't forget to make the separation between them with a comma.__
