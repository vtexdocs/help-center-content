When you're happy with a version of your app, it's time to publish it.

To publish the app to the Registry of the account you're currently working on, just use the following command:

`vtex publish`

By default, `vtex publish` publishes the app in the Registry of the current account (it can be a store account, for example, or an agency one).

This will make your app available to be installed and used in production by users with access to your current account.

The next step is to [install the app](/en/tutorial/installing-the-app).
