On VTEX, you can use [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) to group catalog, price, promotion, inventory, shipping logistics, and payment settings for different sales channels. Sales channels include marketplaces, ecommerce websites, physical stores, or B2B stores, for example.  

The **Trade policies** section of the Admin features a list of all the trade policies added to your store. You can filter the results, search by keyword, and sort your store’s trade policies. The trade policy ID is automatically determined by the system based on the chronological order of creation. 

To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), contact our Growth Operations team through *[Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support)* by selecting **Commercial** and `Create a trade policy`.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), [certified connectors (partners)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-connector-partner), or other VTEX stores is free of charge.

- __Currency Code__: the currency that will be applied to the sales channel that uses this trade policy.  
- __Currency Symbol:__ the symbol of the currency you have selected, which will be displayed with product prices in the sales channel that uses this trade policy. This field is optional. If you leave it blank, the system will fill it in with the default symbol of the selected currency.  
- __Currency Decimal Places__: number of decimal places that product prices can have. This field is optional. If you leave it blank, the system will fill it in with the default value of the selected currency.
