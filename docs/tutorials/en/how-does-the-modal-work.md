The modal attaches an unusual product (meat, glass, mattress etc.) to a carrier that specializes in the delivery of this type of product. For example, not every carrier can deliver meat.

To solve this, you can mark the carriers that have a refrigerated truck with a tag such as __Refrigerator__ tag (that is, with the __Refrigerator__ modal).

When registering an SKU, you can inform that it must be delivered through a specific modal, which restricts the choice of carriers for this SKU. In our example, only those marked with the __Refrigerator__ modal would be available.
