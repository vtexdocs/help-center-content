The **All Orders v2** dashboard is used for monitoring and supervising your store's orders, in addition to performing actions. There you can extract information that will help you manage your business in an intelligent way.


## Order dashboard view

In the **Total Orders** top bar you can monitor your store’s number of orders *today*, *yesterday*, *last week* and *last year*. There is also a ranking that indicates your position in relation to the sum of all completed sales in your store account. These fields include arrows that indicate whether there has been an increase or decrease in the total number of orders. So you can visually monitor the development of your store's sales.

The *Orders* dashboard can be customized through the buttons described below:

**Line density**: using this **button** you can change line density, displaying orders more densely grouped together (`High` option), default density (`Medium`), or less density - loose (`Low`).

**Select Columns**: through the `select columns` button you can define which columns will be displayed, keeping only the fields you want.

## Filters in the orders dashboard

You can refine your store's orders display using the **filters** on the dashboard. They are cumulative, meaning you can apply more than one filter simultaneously. It is possible to filter through the following fields:

**Status**: lists all the possible status of your store’s orders. Click on the filters you want to apply - you can select more than one.
**Creation date**: Set a period for the creation date of your store's orders. Select the start and the end dates on the calendar.
**More**: allows you to create custom filters by selecting them from a series of order fields. Once the field is selected, enter the filter complement in the bar. Example: The selected field `total value` is {{100}} dollars.

## Search for an order

The search bar and the filters on the dashboard make it easier to view your store's orders data.
To search for a specific order using the **search bar**, follow the steps below:

1. In the **Orders Management** module, access the **All orders v2** tab.
2. Enter the keyword you want in the search bar.
  > It is possible to search by the order’s ID, the customer's Individual Taxpayer Registration Number (CPF), customer's name, or email, for example.


## Actions on the Orders dashboard

To manage your orders intelligently, you can perform actions in the *All Orders v2* module. You can **export a report** of your store's Orders, so that you can perform analysis through a CSV file. The data included in the file will depend on the filters applied when you export it. It is also possible to view **orders’ details** in order to resolve possible errors and monitor each one’s flow.


Export Report:
1. In the *Orders Management* module, access the **All orders v2** tab.
2. In the Orders dashboard, click on the **Export Report** button.


View orders’ details:
1. In the **Orders Management** module, access the **All orders v2** tab.
2. Clicking on an `Order’s ID`, you will be directed to a page with the selected order’s details.
