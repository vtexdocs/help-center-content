The VTEX platform allows creating different store architectures starting from a main account, also known as an [account name](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-account-name). You can evolve your main account by adding other account options, such as:

-	**Multistore arquitecture (store name):**
    -	The VTEX Admin will be the same but will have different [store names](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-store-name), which, in turn means different storefronts from the point of view of the end customer.
    - Generally, this resource is used when the store has other brands that have similar logistics and payment methods or when a store needs a separate environment for a different public, for example.
    - All components are shared between store names: catalog, promotions, sitemap, prices, payment settings, and others. However, they can be segmented for different sales conditions through [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV?) and [bindings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-binding--4NcN3NJd0IeYccgWCI8O2W).

- **Additional environment (account):**
    - There will be two VTEX environments, each having a main [account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-account-name), completely separate from one another. Also, all the components of both environments will be configured independently, which expands the options for configuring and segmenting sales conditions and shopping experiences.
    - The additional environment mentioned in this article is not the same as a[ franchise account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl), which shares the catalog with the main account and does not have an independent storefront, even when it operates as a separate VTEX Admin.

This article describes the differences between the multistore and additional environment architectures to help you choose the best one for different scenarios.

## Comparing multistore and additional environment architectures

The following table shows how the different architectures are related to the components and features of the VTEX platform.

| Storefront                       | Each store has a different storefront, but all stores are managed through the same VTEX Admin. If you only want to change the website language, without changing the operation of the store, you can use [multibinding](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciando-conteudo-por-binding--5CZjZPMqi0ZNpuqzF6AUOn) and [catalog internationalization](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/catalog-internationalization) to set that up within the same VTEX environment.<br> <br>Note that this architecture is different from a [franchise account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl); this account doesn't have its own website. Consumers browse directly on the website of the main account, which acts as a marketplace in this case.<br>     | Each account manages its own storefronts in separate VTEX Admins and can use all available options for segmenting storefronts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| VTEX Admin performance           | Linking additional [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV?) to the same main account can affect the performance of the VTEX Admin.

| B2B: Catalog                     | You can't change the unit of measure configured in the catalog for each [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV#catalog). Example: B2B stores sell wholesale, while B2Cs sell in small quantities.<br> <br>The B2B storefront with a centralized catalog will have only one unit in the product page. Depending on your business, you will need to customize the storefront to allow a minimum of units for a given SKU.<br> <br>You can expand the catalog by creating kits, but kits would be created for most products, which basically generates a duplicate of the catalog. | Since the catalogs in each environment are independent, the current multistore environment restrictions don't apply.One of the catalogs can be dedicated to only handle B2B sales.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
