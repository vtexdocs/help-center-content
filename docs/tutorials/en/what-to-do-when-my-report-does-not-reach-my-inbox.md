At VTEX, each store can access a report on [data exports](/tutorial/exporting-data?locale=en) from [Master Data](/tutorial/what-is-master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw) - our module that gathers information about the customers of the store.

These reports are sent to the email owned by the person who requested the action. However, for reasons not concerning VTEX, such content may take longer than expected to reach the requester's inbox.

However, there is a way to extract this report manually by accessing Master Data.

Let's see how in the following step-by-step:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data**.
2. Click __"Exportations"__.![3WNNUZ8EgDZ4iYv8e0OyQG](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/70bXGj3PhkEfcixEF0ik6I/8ebaf7d4ddba8fd8803969c2c98e3c18/3WNNUZ8EgDZ4iYv8e0OyQG.png)
3. Make sure that the tab currently open is __"Applications"__.![7ecXBGaCeC3hTaO0lODPq1](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/rBSEy9DQVSPNEjHLOXjU6/afac5d6a147ad01f1dbb4566bd751510/7ecXBGaCeC3hTaO0lODPq1.png)
4. Under __"Export Status"__, click the report you want to download.

With this, you'll be able access the content even if the original email has not arrived.
