At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Aplazame payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through credit and debit cards, bank invoices and promissories.

To set up your Aplazame affiliation, access [Registering gateway affiliations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/afiliacoes-de-gateway--tutorials_444#).

To set up payment conditions, access [Configure special payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento).

After following the indicated steps, Aplazame connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
