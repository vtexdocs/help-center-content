The movement that money makes when exchanged for a product or service is what we call __transaction__. Thus, payment is only one step in a process that involves an intense flow of information exchange between several parties: [gateways](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway), [sub-acquirers](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-sub-acquirer) and/or [acquirers](/en/tutorial/what-is-an-acquirer), [brands](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-credit-card-brand) and [issuing banks](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-issuing-bank).

In a VTEX store, a transaction starts every time a user chooses a [payment condition](/en/tutorial/difference-between-payment-methods-and-payment-conditions) and closes their order. From there, the purchase data is sent for the validation of each of the members involved in this process. You can track each step of the [transaction flow](/en/tutorial/transaction-flow-in-payments) on the Payments. With this module, you accurately visualize the status of a payment through each status.
