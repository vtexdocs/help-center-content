The Homepage of the admin panel of VTEX stores is the gateway to the platform.  Whenever you want to set up your e-commerce, you must start from there.   

In order to help you improve your performance immediately, it is pre-loaded with metrics that are important for your business.

It also displays VTEX Help content and, right below it, our key novelties for your business. 

## Metrics

The metrics section is divided into three large groups:
- Bridge integration data;
- Payment data;
- Catalog Data.

### Bridge

Marketplace metrics consolidate the error logs of the Bridge module, and the period considered in all of them is the last 7 days. They are divided into three types:
- Total errors in import of orders;
- Total errors in export of products;
- Total errors in updating product prices.

By clicking on the cards, you will be directed to Bridge. Clicking on any log, you will be able to view the exact error message. 

### Payment

There are two metrics regarding payments:

**Pagamento pendente**: using an OMS filter, here we display all payments that are pending in your store, that is, all payments that have not been cancelled yet, and thus, that may still be sold.  Pending orders are cancelled 20 days after the cancellation of the reserve of the order.

**Expired payments w/ active reservations**: this refers to total orders made with bank slips that have already expired but whose products still have an active reserve.  Therefore, these are products that ‘hold back’ your inventory. 
We believe that this information is important for retailers to try to convert the order, since the inventory is still locked.

### Catalog

The two metrics of the Catalog concentrate on opportunities lost:
- **Top products no inventory**: among the top 100 most-viewed products of your store, here we show the products with no inventory. Of course, “viewed product” does not mean that the product was sold, but there are always opportunities that can be tapped with most-viewed products. 
- **Inactive SKUs w/ inventory**: these are inactive SKUs whose products show an “ativar se possível” flag that is on, and that have inventory.  This metrics is important because it means that your store has products with inventory that you may like to display on your shelf.  As a rule, this happens when we forget to include a price or image in the product’s registration.

## Knowledge Base

In addition to the metrics specific to your store, the Homepage displays the most recent documentation of the modules that generate a greater number of queries to our Support area. 

It shows new VTEX Help articles, or those that have been updated recently.  We constantly update our knowledge base, generating new contents on a daily basis.  These changes often come from customers’ doubts of customers.  Since many customers may have the same doubt, we consider essential to include this information on the Homepage. 

Right below the articles, the **Info e Eventos** section shows the novelties about the platform, e-commerce hints, information on electronic commerce events and other disclosures made by VTEX.
