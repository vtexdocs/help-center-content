VTEX charges are always made on an __in arrears basis__. 

So, the period considered is always from the first to the last day of a given month, while invoices are issued in the subsequent month.

## Example 
An invoice is issued on 03/01, referring to "February". It will take into account all orders that got the __approved__ status in the period between 02/01 and 02/28.

>⚠️ If you're charged before your store goes live, note that it relates to the **monthly fee** of your environment maintenance. This value is charged because even though the store is not in production it is already consuming VTEX structure.
