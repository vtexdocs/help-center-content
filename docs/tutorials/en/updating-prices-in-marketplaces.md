Marketplace price updates depend on two factors:

- Editing product prices in the [price table](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/prices-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/1wAm5m3IUfIj6maBdaRJt8) linked to the trade policy used by the marketplace integration.
- [Product indexing](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-how-indexation-works--tutorials_256) after new prices are added.
