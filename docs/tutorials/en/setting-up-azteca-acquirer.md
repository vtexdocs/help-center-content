Azteca, one of Mexico's leading [acquirers](/en/tutorial/what-is-an-acquirer) (also active in Latin American countries such as Panama, Peru, Guatemala, El Salvador and Brazil), can be configured to process payments with bank slips, promissory notes, credit cards, debit and store's brand cards.

To enable Azteca, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Azteca gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __Azteca__ connector.
5. In the __Application Key__ field, enter the application key provided by Azteca.
7. In __Application Token__, fill in the field with the token provided by Azteca.
8. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Azteca will be configured in your store. So when you are registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided that the payment method is compatible with Azteca). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
