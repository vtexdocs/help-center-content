In VTEX Catalog we register the products and define their characteristics.

In this step, we'll register the SKUs barcodes. Barcode is the information that enables products to be easily added to the VTEX Sales App cart. To add a product, we simply read its barcode with a scanner. VTEX Sales App also allows the barcode to be manually entered.

Typically, VTEX Sales App's catalog is inherited from the e-commerce catalog. In this scenario, all you need to do is register the EAN (field that must contain the barcode information) in the SKUs.

To register the EAN for SKUs, follow the steps below:

## Registering the EAN field

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __All products__.
3. In the list of SKUs, click on the SKU name.
4. In the __EAN__ field, fill in the value of the barcode.
5. Click `Save`.

The EAN information may take up to 10 minutes to be updated. After that, you can add the SKU to the VTEX Sales App cart using the barcode scanner.
