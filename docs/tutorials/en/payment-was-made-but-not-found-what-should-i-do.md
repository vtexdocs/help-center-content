In this article, you will find possible reasons why your payment has not been confirmed according to which [VTEX branch](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/nomes-das-filiais-vtex-pelo-mundo--zg05n6OIOZOEmLW7dcq9z?locale=en) the customer is invoiced by. 

The payment must be identified within 48 working hours, and in case it has not been found, you must open a [ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests) with the necessary receipts and select the option **Submit payment receipt**.  

Possible reasons for non confirmation of payment:

### VTEX Billing Branches: Argentina, United States and United Kingdom

- Withholding certificates pending submission.
- The amount paid was different from the invoice value.
- Payment not found by the bank.

You must submit the bank receipt along with the withholding certificates.  

### VTEX Billing Branch: Brazil

- The paid amount is lower than the one charged on the invoice.
- Payment made by a CNPJ that is different from the one registered on the invoice.
- Payment made using a method other than the added one.  

It is essential to submit the bank receipt.

### VTEX Billing Branch: Chile and Mexico

- No payment was found by the bank.
- The amount at the bank is different from the one on the invoice.

For both cases, it will be necessary to submit the bank receipt.

### VTEX Billing Branch: Colombia

- "Certificados de retención" pending submission.
- No payment was found by the bank.
- Different withholdings from those indicated on the invoice.

It is essential to submit the bank receipt and the details of the withholdings applied to the invoice.

## Solving exceptional cases

If your admin access is blocked, you should, exceptionally, submit the necessary receipts to the VTEX branch email, from which you are invoiced.
