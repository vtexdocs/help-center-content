For VTEX, the internal control of Brazilian contracts is operated by Clicksign - an electronic signature platform that allows simple, fast and efficient documents to be signed at any time and place, requiring only the use of the internet.

When receiving our e-mail, the signatories must:

1. Open the document.
2. Click the __Sign__ button.
3. Fill in the required fields (E-mail, Name, CPF, Date of birth, Password).
4. Finish by clicking on __Confirm__.

After that, the digital signature process is completed and your environment is released.

## About Clicksign

Clicksign is 100% digital and complies with Brazilian legislation, including the Provisional Measure 2.200/2001. To ensure security of the document signature process, Clicksign has a number of important procedures, such as registering multiple contractor authentication points (including e-mail address and IP, name and CPF), and the use of electronic lock (which acts as a "fingerprint" to assure the document integrity). Another important feature is the availability of the document to all the signatories, with an easily understandable extract.
