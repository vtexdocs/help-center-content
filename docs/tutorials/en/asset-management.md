## How do you prioritize your organization's most critical assets?

Assets are centrally managed through an inventory management system that stores and tracks the owner, location, status, maintenance, and descriptive information for AWS-owned assets. Once acquired, we check and track all assets and inspect and monitor assets under maintenance for ownership, status, and resolution.

## How would you create the assets within the company?

VTEX operates as a 100% cloud company and is the largest AWS partner in Latin America. Thus, there is no need for physical asset inventory. For software inventory, we use the AWS Systems Manager, which provides visibility into our AWS computing environment. In the corporate scenario, we use a solution to manage endpoints and enforce security rules.
