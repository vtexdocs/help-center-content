The "Recurrency" of a Payment Condition is a special condition that enables us to make available a payment method for a period of time and certain days of the week. 

## How to set it up

To set up the recurrence, firstly it is necessary to set up a [Payment Condition](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions). 
After this, it is possible to set the special conditions and, finally, the recurrence of said condition. 

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on **Payment Conditions** tab. 
3. Click on the payment condition created;
4. Click on **Add special condition**;
5. Select the option **Expiration Date**;
6. We will set the day range for the validity of the payment condition in **Only for this period**;
7. Under the period, we will see the field **Recurrence**. There we can select **Every day** or (Disabling the option "All days") we can select the **weekdays** we want; ee can also set up a time to start and a time to finish;
8. If we want to add another **Recurrency**, click on button `+`;
