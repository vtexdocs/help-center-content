To sign in to the store account, enter the terminal and type:

`vtex login`

The terminal will request the Account, that is, the account name of the store.

![vtex login](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/rs5YFeBAtiYG4KuwcOe8Y/91406e5bfbcbad8ce3efbb56b5a31848/vtex__login.png)

After entering the Account, inform the password, if necessary, and that's it: you're signed in to your account!
