Recently, there has been a large increase in the search for information about the AB test. The subject is being widely discussed by specialists at all meetings relating to the e-commerce market. Why are people so interested in learning more about this subject? The answer is simple: the interest is a result of the evolution of e-commerce in Brazil. 

First, I would like to clarify the difference between AB Testing and Multivariate Testing.

**AB Test:** this is just two (or more) versions of one single page that are developed with a different element in order to test which version will have the best results. These tests are conducted simultaneously, that is, the two versions are run at the same time in order to reach the same audience profile within the same timeframe:

_In this example, we are testing the “button color” element_

**Multivariate Testing:** similarly to AB Testing, is also intended for testing different versions of one single screen. However, several changes are tested for each version developed.

_In the example above, we are testing the “button color” element, the “text” element, and the “font size” element_ 

Considering these differences, let’s discuss why conversion specialists would much rather use AB Testing than Multivariate Testing. 

It’s obvious! Using AB Testing, you know exactly what generated the variation in results and can learn from it. On the other hand, when you use Multivariate Testing, it is impossible to say if the variation was due to the color of the button or the change in the text. 

There are specific sites for disclosure of AB Testing results. In spite of being very useful, they must be analyzed carefully, since not everything that works for audience A will work for audience B. Also, the profile of Brazilian consumers is quite different from the profile of foreign consumers. 

Check out sites whichtestwon.com and abtests.com to learn more about what other store owners are testing. 

With that in mind, some common doubts arise:

- How to conduct these tests?
- Where can I apply them? In which part of the page?
- When can I start testing?
- Why should I spend resources testing my store?

### How?

Currently, there are several tools on the market (paid or cost-free) for making an AB Test. I recommend using Google Analytics, which received resources from the former Google Optimizer to make AB Tests in a simple and fast manner. Just access your account in Analytics and find the tab **Content > Experiments**. The step-by-step can be easily followed, and you will not have much difficulty in running a test.

I also recommend the Visual Website Optimizer tool. Despite being paid, this tool offers more advanced resources for making tests, and it also enables you to make changes on the page without the need to contact your front-end developer. It is worthwhile checking the test version of this tool to learn more about it. 

All tests should be applied for a minimum period of one week, since weekend users have a browsing profile that differs from that of weekday users. When conducting a test, you must consider at least 1,000 prints for each version developed, that is, if you created two versions of one single page, do not draw any conclusion before the test is displayed at least 2,000 times. 

### Where?

Anywhere. All pages of your site can be included in AB Testing. The tests will enable you to have a better understanding of how users think, what works and what does not work on the internet.

Tests can be applied in all page elements, such as button colors, texts, text color, font size, location of an element, page design, insertion of icons, size and type of images etc.
The more you test, the greater will be your knowledge about the profile of users. 

Even if tests do not help to increase your conversion rates, or even if they represent a significant decrease in results, they can be used for improving all other pages and boosting your conversion rates. 

### When?

A great advantage of AB Testing is that end users have no idea that they have participated in a test, since they will see only one version and be sure that that is their original page, regardless of the page presented. 
There is thus no limit regarding the number of tests to be created and applied. So, just keep testing. 

### Why?

I could justify this question in many ways, but I will focus on the most important points:

1. Only through AB Testing will you be able to make the best decisions for your store based on measurable data about your specific audience. Not everything that works for your competitors will work for you;
2. Putting all your chips in a layout that is purely based on the designer’s feeling is dangerous and may result in losses. Personal taste is dangerous;
3. It’s no good investing all your money in attracting traffic to your store, if it is not prepared to receive your visitors and convert them into buyers. Only applying these tests will you be able to know what must be done INSIDE your store to increase your conversion rates and take more advantage of the investment made in advertising, boosting your income, ROI, revenues etc.
