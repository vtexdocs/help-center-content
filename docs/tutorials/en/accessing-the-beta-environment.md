In VTEX, all stores have a beta environment.

This environment is a testing site so the platform user can validate changes to a store before promoting the changes to the main environment.

## How the beta environment works

The beta environment works as a testing environment for different versions of VTEX applications/services in your store. It is an environment that reproduces all the information of the main one (`stable`). So the store data is the same, both in beta and stable. Because of that, __changing data in the beta environment affects data in the stable environment__.

## Accessing the beta environment

The button that gives you access to the beta environment is located at the end of the Admin side menu. Just click `Use beta` to gain access to the testing environment.

<div class="alert alert-info">
To return to the main environment, click <code>Use stable</code>, also located at the end of the Admin side menu.
</div>

## Checking for changes in the beta environment
 
To access your store in beta mode and see how changes have affected your store front, click on the `VISIT THE STORE` button once you have accessed the beta environment described in the previous step.
