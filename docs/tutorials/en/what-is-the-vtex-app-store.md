The __VTEX App Store__ is a repository where you can find all the extensions that may be installed in your VTEX store. They are created and updated by the developers of our ecosystem (which always follow the same quality standards) to meet the most varied needs of the stores.

Thus, we multiply our ability to deliver solutions to our customers, making improvements and new features even more agile.

To check what the __VTEX App Store__ has to offer so far, go to the `apps.vtex.com` link.
