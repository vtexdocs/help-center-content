By default, the minimum value accepted in a cart is set to be $ 0.10. However, you can change this number and specify the value that the store understands to be the right one for your business.

If you change the minimum value from $ 0.10 *(default)* to $ 100, this will prevent the customer from closing the purchase without having at least $ 100 in items in the cart - including rates and freight.

To adjust this value, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Orders > Settings**, or type *Orders* in the search bar at the top of the page and select *Store Settings / Orders*.
2. In the **General** tab, in the **Cart** section, set the value you want in the `Minimum total amount in cart` field.
3. Click `Save`.
