VTEX Admin allows merchants to manage their entire digital commerce experience in one place, in a simple and smart way. This is where they track orders, add products, set up fulfillment, and all the other aspects of a unified commerce operation.

## Homepage
![Store Overview gif EN](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4vKmiLmTVUtaxn5vzpX5xq/27b257963a3bcd2e24374c78e8bcbc4a/Store_Overview_gif_EN.gif)

The homepage provides a high-level overview of your store, like a cockpit for your digital commerce operations, and for this reason it’s called  [Overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/visao-geral-da-loja--6mcM4LPUqQxSiXY6uFtXZy).

As soon as you log in to the Admin, you will see useful metrics and charts to monitor your store's performance, such as revenue and number of orders, sales funnel and conversion rate, and the 10 highest grossing products.

## Navigation menu

Our side navigation menu and top bar group similar categories together to reduce distractions and help your team find what they need faster. You can also use the search bar to find specific sections in the side menu.

![admin navigation menu SEP2023](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2uRMUQWZoiRiuEL70siDJ1/2569ef82429dd4bab5131004749acf22/admin-navigation.png)

You can use the global search bar on the topbar to search for VTEX Admin pages or orders from your store. By default, the search is configured as `Pages`. To search for an order, click on the bar, select `Orders`, and use one of the following criteria:

- Order ID
- Customer name
- Customer email
- Customer document

![avatar settings admin SEP2023](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/52uxBkDXceU5apwZe4ZkaQ/ee5a09f9a303042e1e83bb6ffa4e7982/Avatar_settings2.gif)

Your profile avatar is a central hub for all your user and account settings. By clicking it, you can access your [User settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/user-settings-overview--1qYAvOTZBVYMosJ7tQm3Ry), [Account settings](https://help.vtex.com/v4/docs/account-settings-overview--159BmXTQhaP44wLxtPff6r), and [Billing](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/billing-overview--CcugO41lhNJzQKpazKYQC) information, as well as change the language of your Admin, and log out.

Your profile settings are separate from the store-related settings. This gives you greater control and visibility over the actions that affect your business and the ones that impact a user's profile, such as [roles](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc).
The VTEX Admin offers a localized experience in the following language options:

* Portuguese
* English
* Spanish
* Italian
* Romanian
* Japanese
* Dutch
* French
* Korean
* Bulgarian

### Store Settings

We have grouped the settings of all the Admin sections in one specific menu: [Store Settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/visao-geral-configuracoes-da-loja--5e1Mj7oBDq2NEYJ7cpDdR4). With this improvement, you can easily access all the settings that affect each service in your operation.
