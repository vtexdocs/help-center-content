On the VTEX platform, the price order determines the presentation of the SKU image on the shop window display and on the product page. The product will default to the principal image of the SKU with the lowest price.

## Product's main image

Since in VTEX the image is related to the SKU, not the product, when the client enters the store the picture that will appear on the shop window display is the image of the SKU with the **lowest price.**

This is also valid for the product page. Even if there is a SKU that was registered first, the lowest-priced SKU is the one pre-selected in the view.

## SKU's main image

Among all SKU images, the principal image will be that marked as the principal image in the image register.

As you can see in the example below, even not being the first image registered, the image defined as principal appears on the product page when the SKU is selected.

- When uploading the image spreadsheet, the platform considers line by line; then, the first line of a sku will be considered the main one and so on.
