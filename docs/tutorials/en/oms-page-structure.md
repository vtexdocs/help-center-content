<div class = "alert alert-info">
For documentation on the new Order Management System (OMS) interface, see <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/order-list-beta--2QTduKHAJMFIZ3BAsi6Pi">Order List (Beta)</a>.
</div>

To better understand the __Orders Management__, see the descriptive of each area of the module responsible for the display and management of your store's orders.

## All orders

### Status bar

Displays the total orders for the store on the current day. It also compares orders between the currrent date and the previous day, week and year. Beside each of these values, you can see a percentage that represents the range of today's orders.

The __ranking__ located in the right corner of the bar with these data shows the store position among all VTEX stores, with the metric next to it indicating the evolution between yesterday and today.

The bar doesn't show the exact position of the stores that are in the top 5 positions: for these, the number shown will always be __"Top 5"__.

For all the data of order variations, and also for the numbers of evolution in the ranking, the green color indicates a positive result; blue, neutral; and red, negative.

<div class = "alert alert-warning">
Important: If the order comparison is done based on 0 orders in the past, the variation is 0%.
