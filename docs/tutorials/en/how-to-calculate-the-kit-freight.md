The kit freight is calculated and set up as if it were a single product, that is, for a kit to have delivery availability, it is necessary that the carrier accepts the measures and weights of all the kit components combined. That's because the logistics understands the kit as one package, so it should be sent all at once.

This also means that it is imperative that the whole kit is attended by the same dock and carrier, ensuring that delivery calculation can be performed.
