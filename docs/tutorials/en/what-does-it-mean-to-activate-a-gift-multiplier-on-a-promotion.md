When configuring a **Buy one and Get one** promotion, it’s possible to **Activate a gift multiplier**. As such, the promotion then has two different scenarios to go by:

**First scenario** _Active gifts multiplier_: This new functionality may offer the same number of gifts referring to the number of products purchased. In other words, when choosing an SKU three times, 3 units of the gist are offered.

**Second scenario** _Inactive gift multiplier_: Keeps the prior to launch already existing parameter of this functionality, meaning just one gift per cart.

For both scenarios it is necessary to fill out the maximum selectable quantity. With the **active** gift multiplier, choose the **maximum quantity** of gifts for the condition. For the **inactive** gift multiplier, the quantity is **always 1**.
