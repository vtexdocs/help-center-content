A VTEX app extends the functionalities of the VTEX platform, helping merchants create comprehensive experiences for different layers of digital commerce, such as:

- Marketing and affiliate programs  
- Reviews, ratings, and analytics  
- Customer support and notifications  
- Marketplaces and channels  
- Finance and taxes  
- Logistics and productivity  
- Privacy and security  
- Store design  

Our plug and play solution allows third party developers to create apps for the VTEX ecosystem in multiple ways. Both first-party and third-party apps are available for download at the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/), and they can be either free or paid.

If you are a developer, check the <a href = "https://developers.vtex.com">Developer Portal</a> for more information on how to develop your own VTEX apps.

The Apps menu allows merchants to download new apps directly from the App Store and manage installed apps without leaving the VTEX Admin. Please notice that the Apps menu is flexible and might include custom sections related to the apps installed in your account. 

These operations can be found in the Apps menu of your redesigned Admin.

See below for more details on the different sections and pages of this feature, which will soon be available in the redesigned Admin. 

## Apps management
The Apps management section allows you to:

- Check the complete list of apps available in the App Store.  
- Install new apps, whether they are Admin apps or not, in your account.  
- Configure settings for the installed apps.  
- Uninstall an app.  

This section includes the following pages, soon to be included in the redesigned Admin:

- App Store  
- My Apps  

## Installed Apps
The Installed Apps section includes the configuration settings for the Admin apps installed in your account. Please notice that the pages in this section depend on the apps installed in your account.

## Apps in the redesigned Admin
Our new design system provides a clean, improved, and unified experience with VTEX. As we provide a single experience to users, we highly recommend that third-party apps adapt to the new design system and the updated architecture of building apps for admin@4.x standards. We will soon make the Admin's new design system and developer docs available so you can start building third-party apps for the new Admin.
