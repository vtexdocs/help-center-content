__The Catalog is one of the modules of the store's Admin.__ In it, you find the main settings that let you manage your products.

In the Catalog, products are organized by categories, and categories are organized by hierarchical levels.

An example of a catalog structure would be as follows:

![img como funciona o catalogo](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/3AXUNSkDagO06cKmMsq6w4/5e80021d54e3fa58f9b0c6a261e1f407/img_como_funciona_o_catalogo.png)

<div class = "alert alert-warning">
Your categories tree does not need to have three levels. The hierarchy shown above is just an example. The amount of category levels to be created depends very much on the sector of activity of each store.
</div>

Once you create your store and register your products, you'll get a more concrete and organized view of what you've read here.

In addition, in Admin you will be able to perform numerous tests in your store, before making it live, in order to better understand the tools available in the Catalog and its features.
