At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the GlobalPayments payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through credit and debit cards.

To set up your GlobalPayments affiliation, access [Registering gateway affiliations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/afiliacoes-de-gateway--tutorials_444#).

To set up payment conditions, access [Configure special payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento).

After following the indicated steps, GlobalPayments connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
