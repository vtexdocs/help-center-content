If you wish to unlink an SKU from the product to which it is already registered and then link it to another product, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __All products__.
3. Click the SKU you want to change.
4. In the __Product Name (Id)__ field, in the __Current Selection__ area, click `Remove`.
5. In the same field __Product Name (Id)__, click the second white button. A search box will open.
6. In this search box, type the name of the product to which you want to link the SKU.
7. Select the product and click `Apply and Close`.
8. Click `Save`.

Ready! Your SKU is now linked to a new product.
