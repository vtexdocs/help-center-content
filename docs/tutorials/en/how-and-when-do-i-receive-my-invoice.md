<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><p>This procedure only applies to customers billed in <strong>Brazil.</strong></div>

The billing is triggered until the 5th business day of the month. Invoice and *boleto* (Brazilian offline payment method) are available on the __Billing__ module in the Admin of your store.

When a charge is made, we send an email to the registered contacts advising that the invoice and the *boleto* are already available for payment or consultation.

If you have not received the notice by the 5th business day of the month, [check your administrative panel](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-download-the-vtex-invoices--tutorials_653). If you identify any divergence, [contact our](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en/requests) financial team.

If you are unable to download your *"boleto"*, you may not have a financial profile configured in your store account. In this case, ask the account's Super Admin to add it.

If you are not receiving the emails that inform that the *"boleto"* is available for download on the platform, the email address may not be registered as a financial contact. In this case, open a [ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en/requests) to request the inclusion of the email address in the account's financial contacts.
