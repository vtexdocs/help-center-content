The VTEX platform allows users with an admin role to create and manage custom fields when adding new organizations or cost centers. This feature simplifies the inclusion of specific and relevant information for the company.

## Defining and managing fields

Users with an admin role can define additional fields in the VTEX Admin, which will be displayed when adding new organizations or cost centers. These custom fields are designed to capture specific and useful information that is not available on the registration form.

## Adding a custom field

Custom fields enable users to add specific and personalized information for organizations or cost centers. These fields can be tailored to the company's needs to obtain relevant information.

To add a custom field, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > B2B Organizations and Cost Centers > Organizations**, or type **Organizations** in the search bar at the top of the page.

2. Click the **Custom Fields** tab.

3. Choose between the Organizations or Cost centers options in the selection box.

4. Click the **Add Field** button. An empty row will be added to the list of custom fields.

5. Under the empty row, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i> to edit.

6. Complete the required information:
    - **Use on Registration:** Indicates whether the field should be displayed in the registration form.
    - **Field Type:** Determines whether the field will be text or a list with selectable values.
    - **Custom Field Name:** Name of the field you want to customize.
7. Click `Update`.

Make sure you click `Save Settings` in the top right corner to apply the changes.
