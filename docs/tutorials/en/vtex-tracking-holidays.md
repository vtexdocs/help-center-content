IN PROGRESS...

>ℹ️ Registering Holidays is solely linked to the delivery scheduling functionality which is only available for VTEX Tracking users with system integration.

Customers receive a communication via email or SMS containing the scheduled delivery date for their order. If the customer knows that they will not be available to receive their package at the given time, they can reschedule delivery for another date and delivery window.

The Holiday feature blocks observed holidays during the delivery rescheduling. That way, those dates will not be available as an option for the customer. The VTEX Tracking system automatically registers national holidays, except religious ones. Religious holidays, state holidays, and municipal holidays must be registered by the user that has the delivery drivers on the way. In this article you will learn about:
