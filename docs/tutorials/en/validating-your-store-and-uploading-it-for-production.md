At the end of the project, you may have doubt about whether the project is complete and ready to be uploaded. In addition to check whether all [tasks of the schedule template](/en/tutorial/using-the-project-task-timeline) have been completed, the store must be validated.

_This validation does not include the points of interface of the store; however, it is extremely important that the entire store is validated, which can be done by browsing the store to simulate the behavior of end customers, checking whether: all links are being directed to the right site; all banners are updated; all texts have a correct writing; all categories and products are properly positioned, and several issues that can be analyzed while browsing the store._
