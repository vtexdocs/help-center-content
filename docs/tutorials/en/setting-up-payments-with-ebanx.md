At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Ebanx payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through bank invoice, credit cards and PIX.

To configure Ebanx affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payments > Settings__, or type __Settings__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the `+` button.
3. Click on the __Ebanx__ connector.
4. Click on __Authorize__. You will be redirected to the Ebanx environment.
5. In the Ebanx environment, enter your Ebanx account login and password. Follow the indicated instructions to complete the Ebanx account linking with VTEX.
6. After returning to __Admin VTEX__, click on `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Ebanx, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, Ebanx connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
