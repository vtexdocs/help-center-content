At VTEX, the user has the option to automate the sending of emails to his clients by using the [Message Center](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/--tutorials_84) module. There are already some pre-configured templates available on the platform, which may be customized according to user preference.

This funcionality is however not mandatory. You can opt out of sending these messages if that's more advantageous for the store.

As example, we will use the step-by-step on how to disable the pending payment email, which is sent 48 hours after placing the order. It's worth noting that customizing this time interval is not possible. 

Proceed with the following steps:

1. Access the __Message Center__.
2. Click on __Templates__.
3. Type in __Payment Pending__ in the search box.
4. Uncheck the __Enable email sending__ option.

5. Click on __Save__.

From now on, pending payment emails will no longer be sent out.
