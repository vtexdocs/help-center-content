One of the main challenges for retailers, distributors and industries that are migrating to a marketplace and dropshipping model is to onboard new sellers and offer the right tools for the partnership to be successful. From integration to catalog synchronization to sending and receiving orders, the process can be slow, complex, and costly.

We have developed the Seller Portal to bring more speed and simplicity to this journey, helping to unlock new sources of revenue for our customers.

The Seller Portal is an edition of the VTEX platform for VTEX or third-party sellers to connect and sell their products on marketplaces. The portal provides sellers with the essential capabilities for the ecommerce operation in large window displays, increasing visibility and sales conversion.

Now, marketplaces hosted on VTEX can invite and connect with sellers more quickly and seamlessly, expanding their product assortment and customer base.

Through the Seller Portal, sellers are able to:

- Have an environment that is automatically connected to the marketplace.  
- Activate their catalog in the marketplace to start selling immediately.  
- Manage shared products through a marketplace shared catalog.  
- Update inventory and product prices.  
- Manage and invoice all their orders in the marketplace, being able to process payments.  
- Build and manage their operation's logistics strategy.  
- Decrease the "time to revenue" of their sales.  

## What to expect from the Seller Portal?

Here are some details about the Seller Portal:  

- Only marketplaces will be able to create and manage product promotions.
- The catalog architecture can be shared between marketplace and seller through product sharing. The seller, however, can create their own products by defining categories, brands, and specifications.
- When the seller chooses to share the catalog with the marketplace, the shared products have the same categories, brands, and specifications as defined by the marketplace. However, only the categories are fully imported into the seller's environment. Brands are imported only when a product is imported and specifications are not imported.
- If the payment is processed by the marketplace, commission disbursement and seller payouts are not handled by VTEX.  
- Support for the seller’s experience will be provided by the marketplace operator.    

**What we’re launching now**  
- Environment automatically connected to the marketplace.  
- Marketplace’s orders management.   
- Logistic operation management.  
- Shared catalog with marketplace.  
- Managing seller’s own assortment of products  

## Setting up your store

>⚠️ The limit for each Seller Portal account is 100 thousand products. For more information, please contact our <a href="https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests">Support.

To start selling your products on the marketplace, you need to configure your store on the Seller Portal. This article explains the complete flow of this initial setup and indicates other documentation for you to access each step in more detail. The basic configuration of the Seller Portal includes the steps listed below.

### 1. Catalog

The Seller Portal Catalog is the module where you configure your store’s product assortment. For customers to see your products on the marketplace, you need to add and configure them through the Catalog, using the Seller Portal or REST API.

To access the Seller Portal Catalog, go to the sidebar and click on **Products > Shared Products / Products**.

To manage the Seller Portal Catalog using REST API, check out the [Catalog API - Seller Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api-seller-portal) documentation.

### 2. Prices

For a product to be sold, your customer needs to know how much each item displayed on the marketplace costs. The Prices module is the system responsible for creating, editing and storing pricing data for your products and their variations. To access the Prices module, go to the sidebar and click on Products > Price List / Price Rules.

 To learn more, check out the following articles:  

- [Pricing Module Overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP)  
- [Adding a base price](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/P99EjtrlRHk92Q8qDPq29)  

### 3. Logistics

Your Seller Portal’s Logistics configuration allows you to build the most appropriate inventory and delivery strategy for your business. These configurations are used at checkout, for example, for the system to calculate the shipping rate for an order. They are also needed after an order is placed and its payment is authorized - when the journey to the final customer actually begins.

A delivery’s logistics route starts in the inventory, continues to the loading docks, and, afterward, the carriers finish the process, delivering the products to the customers’ addresses.

The Seller Portal has some pre-configured features to facilitate your interaction with the platform. To access the logistics modules, go to the sidebar and click on Shipping > Shipping Rates / Shipping Simulator / Pickup Points / Shipping Strategy. Your account has a standard inventory and loading dock, and it is not necessary to change this configuration for your store to sell in the marketplace. However, you need to conclude the logistical configuration by adding the following features:    

- [Carrier](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140)    
- [Shipping rates](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-valores-de-frete--tutorials_141)    
- [Geolocation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-geolocalizacao--tutorials_138)    
- [Shipping spreadsheet](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planilha-de-frete--tutorials_127)    

### 4. Inventory

To sell your products on the marketplace, you need to update the number of items available in your inventory. The Seller Portal has the Manage Items in Stock tool, with which you can update the number of items available in a given inventory whenever necessary. To access the Inventory, go to the sidebar and click on Products > Inventory Management. To learn more, check out the following article:  

- [Inventory Management](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-itens-em-estoque--tutorials_139)

### 5. Payment 

On VTEX, the Payments module is the system responsible for managing all actions related to your store’s financial flow. It is important to note that each store has its own particularities, which influences the way of building your business’ Payments module. Therefore, to configure your financial flow, it’s important to keep in mind the store’s real needs and purposes and what was agreed with the marketplace.

Both the seller and the marketplace can be responsible for processing payments for an account. This must be agreed between them before payment configuration is made on the Seller Portal.

__Marketplace processing payment:__ the entire payment flow is the responsibility of the marketplace, so the seller does not need to configure any functions. It's important to note that commission disbursement and seller payouts are not handled by VTEX.

__Seller processing payment:__ if the seller is allocated as the payment processor, follow the steps in the articles below to configure the Payments module in your store.

### 6. Selling products

Whenever a product or variation is created on the Seller Portal, they are automatically sent to the marketplace. However, this does not mean that this product is ready to be displayed on the marketplace window display and then sold. Price and inventory conditions must be configured for it to become available for sale.

“Offer” is how we call a product or variation from a seller that was sent to the marketplace and whose price and inventory have been configured. When you set up price and inventory conditions, you are preparing your product or variation for it to become an offer. Once the price and inventory conditions are configured, the product becomes an offer in the marketplace’s window display. To learn more, check out our article:  

- [Seller Portal: Offers and Sending Products to the Marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/es/tutorial/anuncios-y-envio-de-productos-al-marketplace--3RwSj7AyBoPtFbXkS7REiu)  

### 7. Orders
The moment the end customer pushes the Checkout button, an order is generated inside VTEX. This means that you will now be able to track the order flow through the Order Management module within your store's admin panel. That is, you can now know the details of each step throughout the order progress. To access the Orders module, go to the sidebar and click on Orders > All Orders / Transactions.

 - [How Orders work in VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/orders--2xkTisx4SXOWXQel8Jg8sa/2sl6hj2eqwgqbDgTF6y5qE)  

### 8. Creating and managing promotions

The **Promotions** page on the Seller Portal allows sellers and marketplaces to create promotions and manage a complete list of registered promotions, simplifying promotion management.

To learn more, check out the following articles:

- [Seller Portal: Promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-promocoes--73LL7Ja0P4JbD77AH0jHwu)  
- [Seller Portal: Creating a promotion](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-criar-uma-promocao--kzNPEaiJE8EWkDzO9dbBI)  

### 9. Supervising Offer Management

The _Offer Management_ module allows sellers to monitor their offers’ submission and synchronization on all channels integrated with the store. The main page features two components that display in real-time the status of the offers and their updates based on data from the marketplace and other VTEX modules. It’s where sellers can track all interactions of Catalog, Price, or Stock type in their offers in order to identify errors while sending and syncing offers.

### 10. Sales Performance Dashboard
The _Dashboards_ menu is a control panel that displays data for your unified commerce. The analyses presented here can inform decisions and help prioritize tasks for different professionals, from operations to commercial and marketing. The Dashboards include up-to-date data from all sales channels in which your store operates with VTEX, including key metrics that impact your store revenue.

## Optional configurations

There are additional features that you can implement in your store, but they are not mandatory to operate and sell in the marketplace.

### 1. Store, Account and Profile Settings

We have grouped all settings that affect your store under Store Settings, in the left navigation menu. Settings that apply to your account or user profile are accessed separately.

Your profile avatar, on the upper right corner now hosts all the settings related to your user and account. Through the avatar you can access user settings, account settings, billing information, change your Admin’s locale and logout.

**Store Settings**
These settings are applied to your store, storefront and how users interact with your shopping experience. They include Order Settings, Email templates, Shipping Settings and Price Settings.  To access this feature, click on the Store Settings icon in the left-side navigation menu. 

The *Message Center* module should only be used if agreed between seller and marketplace that the seller will be responsible for communicating with customers during an order's flow. We suggest that the seller contacts the marketplace to know more.  

**Account settings**
These are settings that apply to your store's account in VTEX. They include User Roles, Account, Authentication and Users tabs. To access this feature, click on your profile avatar in the upper right corner > Account settings.

If more people in your operation need to access the Seller Portal, account Owners can add new users. To learn more, check out the following articles:

**Profile Settings**
These settings apply to your individual user profile. They include Personal Data and Authentication. To access this feature, click on your profile avatar in the upper right corner > User settings.

### 2. Integrating your ERP system

If your business already has an ERP system in place, it is possible to integrate it with VTEX. The integration will allow you to import to the Seller Portal, in bulk and automatically, some information that is relevant to your operation. 

Catalog integration must be done manually through the Seller Portal interface or massively through REST API, using [Catalog API - Seller Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api-seller-portal). It is not possible to integrate Catalog via spreadsheet nor via SOAP API (Webservice).

The features configured from the integration can also be configured manually through the Seller Portal, following the basic configuration mentioned at the beginning of this article.

The integration will allow you to configure the following features via REST API:

- Create and update products, brands and categories
- Import prices
- Import inventory
- Configure order integration
- Configure order processing

There will be no need for manual configuration for these modules, but we recommend that you review the catalog, price and inventory data that were imported by the integration. 

To integrate with your ERP, check out our [ERP integration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-guide).

>ℹ️ To generate the access keys necessary to integrate with your ERP, click on your **profile avatar**, marked by the initial of your email and go to **Account settings > Application keys**.
