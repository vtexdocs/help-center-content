All orders that receive the approved status in the **Orders management** module are considered as “revenues”.


For VTEX, once the order is financially approved, its total value is considered, including the shipping rate, a tax applied to the product price.


All orders that received this status are considered on the invoice, regardless of any subsequent cancellation.


Even in the case of tests, later cancellations or Anti-Fraud, we understand that the entire platform has been used, since this is the stage at which the customer completes the entire purchase process, having used the Search, Infra and Hosting resources, for example.


To learn how to access the orders that were considered for revenues calculation, read this article [here](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-access-the-value-of-approved-revenues--tutorials_4322).


All financially approved orders will receive this status, which can be seen in the orders management module:
