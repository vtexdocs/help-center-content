At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the PayU India payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through credit cards and promissories.

To configure PayU India affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the __+__ button.
3. Click on the __PayuIndia__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__, __Public API Key__, __Soft descriptor__ and __Type of refund__ fields with data provided by PayU India.
5. In the __Early capture__ field, choose how long you want the capture to take place (after transaction approval and anti-fraud review). You can also disable the function.
6. In __Have an anti-fraud deal with this affiliation?__, select whether your store will use an anti-fraud deal with this connector.
7. Click on __Save__.

To set up payment conditions, access [Configure special payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento).

After following the indicated steps, PayU India connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
