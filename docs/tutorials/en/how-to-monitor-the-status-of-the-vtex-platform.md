VTEX makes available several resources for storeowners to monitor the overall status of the e-commerce platform. We believe that transparency is essential for continuous improvement.

We have three main sources of useful content for monitoring the health of the platform:

**1 - [Healthcheck](http://healthcheck.vtex.com/)**

A real-time dashboard that provides a visual display of the health of each of the VTEX modules.

**2 - [Releases](http://releases.vtex.com/#/releases/)**

VTEX loads over 8,000 versions per annum. All publications are available for consultation, including the developers’ notes about each one.

**3 - [Status](http://status.vtex.com/)**

Easy and quick monitoring of the health of the main services affecting the operation of your store, including a brief incident report.

_If your store is off the air, check whether your hosting settings (DNS) are correct. For further information about DNS click [here](/en/tutorial/configuring-dns-pointing-to-vtex/)and verify that the pointing is correct, following all the recommended steps.
