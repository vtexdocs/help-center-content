This article is part of the [Categoria](/en/tutorial/registering-a-category) &gt; [Campo de Produto](/en/tutorial/creating-a-product-field) &gt; [Campo de SKU](/en/tutorial/creating-sku-fields) settings.

Specification Types can vary from among Texto, Texto Grande, Número, Combo, Radio, CheckBox, Texto Indexado and Texto Grande Indexado.

Each one will deal with a different demand, according to its personalities described below:

**Texto**

Content is filled out as free text, but not indicated for large HTML structures, like for example to inform about the components comprising the delivery of the Product.

**Texto Grande**

Content is filled out as free text, indicated for large HTML structures, like for example in the case of specific Measurement Tables – used a lot nowadays in the fashion segment for bigger sizes.

**Número**

Content is filled out using whole numbers only, like for example when specifying shoe sizes (8, 9, 11...).

**Combo**

Two pre-defined values are usually created in this field. In the SKU register, so as to have a box an options combo for defining the components, like for example, the voltage of some electrical product, which will only vary between 110v and 220v.

**Radio**

Various pre-defined values are created in this field. In the SKU register, so as to have a range of options that will vary from SKU to SKU. Such as for defining the Color of the components (red, yellow, blue, black,&#8230;).

**CheckBox**

Here one ‘true’ and ‘false’ values are shown. That is, this will be a field whose value will be enabled or disabled. Such as the “Outlet” flag, which will only be flagged when the product is part of a fire sale when it is definitely leaving the range.

**Texto Indexado and Texto Grande Indexado**

Technically speaking, they follow the same rule as that of Text fields mentioned above; however, since they are classified as “Indexado”, the value to be filled in will also be intended for the searches that the end-customer does on Google.
