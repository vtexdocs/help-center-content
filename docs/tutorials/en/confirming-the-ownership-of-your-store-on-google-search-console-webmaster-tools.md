There are two ways to confirm the ownership of your website using Google Webmaster Tools.

- [App](#app)
- [Meta tag](#mata-tag)

## App

You can use the [Google Search Console app for VTEX](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-google-search-console/p). Check the [app documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-google-search-console).

## Meta tag

1. Go to your [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) account. If you have not set up a website, click **Add Site** or, if you already have a website, click **Manage Website** > **Verify website**.

2. Use the **HTML Tag** alternative method. This method generates an HTML meta tag that has to be inserted in the _head_ section of the store home page.

3. After inserting the meta tag in your templates, make sure that the meta tag is in your store’s home page HTML using the browser option **View page source**. Then, click `Verify`.
