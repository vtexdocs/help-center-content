To see the workspaces that currently exist in an account, simply use the following command:

`vtex workspace list`

Check out this example:

![workspace list](https://images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/2au4D7r6YkmskO0Ko8esC6/aa635baf0e6f543c0e08ee2613e20127/workspace_list.png)

The columns that will appear are as follows:

- __Name__: name of the workspace.
- __Last Modified__: date of last modification made to the workspace.
- __State__: whether the workspace is ready for development (`production false`) or for production (`production true`).

By default, every account is created with the __master__ and __draft__ workspaces.
