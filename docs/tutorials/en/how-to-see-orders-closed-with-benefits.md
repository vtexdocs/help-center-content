In the section __Orders management__ you can filter the orders made in a certain period using as criterion one or more benefits applied in those orders.

If you want to see the orders that were closed with this benefit applied, just follow the steps below:

1. In the admin menu, click on __Orders management__
2. Click the filter button and, under the __Others__ section, click the __Promotions & Taxes__ option.![promo-filter-en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1JFiP4ZNhmu4cWcOK4Ugs8/cdebe29a683b1561ddaacd034bbaeb1b/promo-filter-en.png)
3. Select this benefit and click on __Confirm__

In the order list, you'll see all orders closed with this benefit.

If you want to have a spreadsheet with these orders, just click the [export order spreadsheet](/en/tutorial/exporting-orders-with-oms) button.
