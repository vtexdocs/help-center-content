Credomatic is a [payment gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that operates in the Americas and processes payments with major credit card brands.

To configure Credomatic, follow the steps below:

## Setting up credomatic gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __Credomatic__ connector.
5. In the __Key Id__ field, fill in the ID used to access your control panel at Credomatic.
6. In __Key__, enter the security key associated with the ID.
7. In the __Transaction Type__ field, select the option that is already checked by default.
8. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Credomatic will be configured in your store. So while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with Credomatic). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
