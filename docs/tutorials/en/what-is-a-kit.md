A kit is an SKU composed of one or more SKUs. SKUs that make up a kit are called __components__.

In a standard kit, the products are sold together, ie they can not be offered for sale separately. This means that in a "Beach" kit consisting of the SKUs "Trunks" and Towel, the customer will only be able to purchase the SKUs together.

However, you can also choose another kit mode, called __Kit Look__, in which component SKUs are displayed together, but __can be sold separately__.

In both cases, the kit SKU will consider the component stocks and the SKU price of the kit.
