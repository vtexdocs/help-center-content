<div class = "alert alert-info">
In <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-my-account-works--2BQ3GiqhqGJTXsWVuio3Xh">My Account</a>, customers can only access their orders from the last two years.
</div>

The new [My Account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-does-my-account-work--2BQ3GiqhqGJTXsWVuio3Xh) is already installed in all VTEX accounts pertaining to a <strong>test environment</strong>, allowing adjustments on the new page to be implemented without impacting user experience.

This means that My Account already makes it possible for your store to customize when needed, before the app's bulk migration to production, through the link shown below:

[https://{{AccountName}}.myvtex.com/_secure/account?workspace=myaccounttest#/profile](https://{{AccountName}}.myvtex.com/_secure/account?workspace=myaccounttest#/profile)

To customize the page, you need to:

1. Access the link, replacing the `{{AccountName}}` value with the name of your VTEX account.
2. Authenticate yourself using the __Receive email access code__ or __Access using email and password__ option
3. Enter __My Account__, located in the upper left side of your screen next to __My Cart__

>ℹ️ Stores created after May 15th, 2019, need not worry about customization adjustments, since the platform already comes with the native app.
