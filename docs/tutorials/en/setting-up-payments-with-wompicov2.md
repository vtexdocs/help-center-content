3. Click on the __WompiCoV2__ connector.
4. Click on __Authorize__. You will be redirected to the Wompi environment.
5. In the Wompi environment, enter your Wompi account login and password, and click on __Vincular cuenta__. Follow the indicated instructions to complete the Wompi account linking with VTEX.
6. After returning to VTEX Admin, click on `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by WompiCoV2, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).
