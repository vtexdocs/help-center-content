You may not know, but Limited Liability Commpanies (LLC) are the most common type of companies in Brazil.

Its main objective is to regulate the opening of a company considering the investment of partners to the share capital.

The term "limited" means that each associate has their share defined based on their contribution, which may be equivalent or partial, specified in the company's opening agreement.

## SaaS companies

By the market convention, SaaS companies (Software as a Service), like VTEX, assume no responsibilities beyond those already established in its terms of adhesion. This is because, in the absence of a limitation, the financial and economic balance of the relationship between service provider (VTEX) and contractor would be unfeasible. 

Therefore, the economic activity of the service provider would be put at risk, generating a risk of eventual bankruptcy of the company, which no contractor would want.

Therefore, any kind of change in clauses relating to our limited liability is unfeasible.

## Global Council

Understanding the risk of losing their suppliers in the face of adverse situations, customers of software-as-a-service companies formed a global board, called [Cloud Standards Customer Council](http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/public-cloud to-expect-what-to-expect-and-what-to-negotiate.htm), for the purpose of giving opinions on reasonable expectations and responsibilities in a relationship such as this. __These terms were defined by the customers themselves, without interference from the companies in the sector.__

## Customers
Among these customers, you will find the largest global brands in the industrial, retail and service sectors. Check [here](http://www.cloud-council.org/member-list.htm) the full list.
