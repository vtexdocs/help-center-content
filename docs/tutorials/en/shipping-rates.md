Shipping rates are the shipping options your store offers to customers, and they are related to your store's [shipping policies](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140). Prices agreed between your store and the responsible for the delivery service, such as carriers, pickup points, and service providers, must be configured as **shipping rates.**

You can add shipping rates in the Admin by using:

* The `Shipping strategy` page: you must upload the [shipping rate template](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127) when adding a `Shipping policy` or updating an existing one. We recommend this option for adding many postal codes and their shipping costs at a time. 
* The `Shipping rates` page: for when you want to update existing rates or add a few. It allows you to edit and add shipping rates without using the shipping rate template. To learn more, see our tutorial [Managing shipping rates](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-shipping-rates--tutorials_141).

<div class="alert alert-warning">
The <b><a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127">shipping rate template</b></a> is the only option for configuring the location polygon (geolocation), the <b>insurance cost</b> and <b>additional shipping costs</b>. 
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you need to update or add multiple shipping rates, we recommend using the <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127">shipping rate template</a> instead of the <b>Shipping rates</b> module. If you want to check out how shipping rates are added and displayed to the end customer, use the <b><a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-simulation--tutorials_144">Shipping simulator</b></a> module.
