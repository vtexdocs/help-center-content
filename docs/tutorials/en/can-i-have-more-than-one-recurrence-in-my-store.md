The number of recurrences is unlimited for both your store and your customer. This means there is no maximum limit for recurrences that can be sold by your store or purchased by your customer.
 
However, you should be aware of the conditions that are applied in the recurrences:
 
## Different products with the same frequency
Different products or services, purchased on close dates and with the same frequency will have their recurrence scheduled for the same day. In such cases, __the system unifies the date of the next purchase__ for the two products/services, using as a reference the date on which the first item was purchased.
 
## Same products with different frequencies
When the same product or service is purchased twice, but with different frequencies, __the system will always consider the most recent purchase information__. That is, the first recurrence is canceled and only the one last hired will be valid.
