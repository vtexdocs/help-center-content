Fields (or Specifications) are properties that you can add to your SKUs to assign specific features to your store products. Fields allow you to present more detailed SKUs.

In structural terms, for these specifications to appear in your store, you must register the group they will belong to, define the field names and include their values. Only after you have walked this path will you be able to assign your SKUs to these specifications.

If your store sells electronics, for example, its specification group may be named __Features__, the field __Voltage__ and its values __110V__ and __220V__.

These are the fields that determine the characteristic attributes of your SKU.
