You can configure Stelo's transparent solution in your store. With it, your customers are not redirected to an external environment to complete the purchase of a product or service in your store.

To set SteloM1V2 up, follow the steps below:

## Setting up SteloM1V2 gateway affiliation
1. Enter the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __SteloM1V2__ connector.
5. In the __Application Key__ field, fill in the key provided by Stelo.
6. In __Application Token__, enter the token provided by Stelo.
7. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, SteloM1V2 will be configured in your store. So while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided that the payment method is compatible with SteloM1V2). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
