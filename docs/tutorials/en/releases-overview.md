>ℹ️ The **Releases** is in beta version, which means we are working to improve it. This feature is only available for stores using [FastStore](https://www.faststore.dev/).

The **Releases** menu allows you to manage groups of related changes to coordinate the planning, creation, scheduling, and publishing of changes in your store. The changes or groups of changes that **Releases** can publish together are known as [releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-release-concept-beta--4pWhQTXG0aIIsi2TYxxRkZ).

>⚠️ In the beta version, releases must be [CMS](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2)-related, because other VTEX platform modules are not yet included. To use the **Releases**, you must configure the CMS as described in [Installing Releases on VTEX Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/cms/vtex-headless-cms/Installing%20Releases%20on%20VTEX%20Headless%20CMS).

Check out below the pages available in the **Releases** menu.

## Calendar

On the [Calendar](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-pagina-calendario-beta--46wSZ7Z5xoXQPP0xHfIx9C) page, you can create a new release and perform several other [actions on releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-actions-on-releases-beta--1zsomdifPEQkdV6RW93JyW). You can view the **Calendar** page in three ways:

- [View per month](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-pagina-calendario-beta--46wSZ7Z5xoXQPP0xHfIx9C#view-per-month): Displays the releases scheduled for the selected month.
- [View per week](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-pagina-calendario-beta--46wSZ7Z5xoXQPP0xHfIx9C#view-per-week): Displays the releases scheduled for a given week.
- [View per day](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-pagina-calendario-beta--46wSZ7Z5xoXQPP0xHfIx9C#view-per-day): It shows the releases scheduled for the selected day and the changes related to the selected release.

## Releases

In [Releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-releases-page-beta--2p7IiVD6K8i1iRiwHph5sw), you can create a new release and perform several other [actions on releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-actions-on-releases-beta--1zsomdifPEQkdV6RW93JyW). On this page, all existing releases are presented in a list showing first the releases with `Not scheduled` [status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-release-concept-beta--4pWhQTXG0aIIsi2TYxxRkZ#status-of-releases), followed by those that are scheduled.

The scheduled releases are sorted by release date: you can see the most recent releases at the top of the list and the oldest ones at the bottom.
