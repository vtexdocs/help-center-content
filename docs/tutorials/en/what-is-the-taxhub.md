In B2B, taxes should be explicitly presented, just like in invoices issued. In foreign markets such as the United States and Canada, this need occurs even in B2C. To satisfy this demand, VTEX releases its Tax System to improve its platform and meet the market needs. 

With the tax system, companies specialized in tax calculation may integrate with VTEX protocol and provide services to VTEX customers. With this functionality, it will be possible to develop the most diversified taxes. 

### Examples of use 

- A store specialized in B2B sales wants to present its products in the shopping cart without including the tax amounts. With the tax system, it is possible to set up the use of the ICMS-ST tax; when the customers add items to the cart, the tax will be dynamically calculated with freight and discounts. 

- In Dominican Republic, it is mandatory to show the tax amounts detailed in the shopping cart. Stores operating in these countries may install and set up taxes to show them in the cart at the time of the purchase. 

### Pre-requisites
-	The app developed by the provider that calculates taxes should be in node.js technology
-	The app must be installed in the “TaxHub” module through zipped folder in the .zip format
