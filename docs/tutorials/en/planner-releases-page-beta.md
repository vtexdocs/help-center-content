<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>The <strong>Releases</strong> is in beta version, which means we are working to improve it. This feature is only available for stores using <a href="https://www.faststore.dev/">FastStore</a>.</p>
</div>

The **Releases** module allows you to [manage your releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-release-concept-beta--4pWhQTXG0aIIsi2TYxxRkZ) so that you can coordinate the creation, schedule and publication of the changes in your store.

In the navigation menu of the **Releases** in the VTEX Admin, you'll find the **Releases** and [Calendar](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-calendar-page-beta--46wSZ7Z5xoXQPP0xHfIx9C) pages. You can create a new release and perform other [actions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-actions-on-releases-beta--1zsomdifPEQkdV6RW93JyW) under **Releases**.

On the **Releases** page, you'll see all existing releases listed by the `Not scheduled` [status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-release-concept-beta--4pWhQTXG0aIIsi2TYxxRkZ#status-of-releases) releases first, followed by those already scheduled. 

The order of the scheduled releases is based on the publication date: The further into the future a release is, the sooner it'll appear on the list. However, the older the release is, the latest it'll appear.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>In the beta version, releases must be <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2">CMS</a>-related, because other VTEX platform modules are not yet included. To use the <strong>Releases</strong>, you must configure the CMS as described in <a href="https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/cms/vtex-headless-cms/Installing%20Releases%20on%20VTEX%20Headless%20CMS">Installing Releases on VTEX Headless CMS</a>.</p>
