Integration with B2W operates as follows:

SkyHub provides a queue with the orders placed on B2W and VTEX completes these orders. Between these two operations there is a natural time interval, just as there is an interval between the moment when the orders in your store are generated by the Checkout and consumed by the Orders Management.

In general, an order placed on B2W must be indexed in SkyHub and then placed in the queue. This process usually takes **up to 1 hour**. Since VTEX constantly consumes this queue, orders do not accumulate. As they enter, they are distributed to each store.
