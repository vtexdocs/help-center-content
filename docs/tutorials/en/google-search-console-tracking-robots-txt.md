robots.txt is a text file that search engines use to define site scanning rules for crawlers.

VTEX has a native interface for editing and customizing the robots.txt file.

Go to: Store Settings > Storefront > Settings > SEO > Robots.txt

For a better understanding of the content, see below a detailed description of the basic functions:

- **Allow:** by using this word, you will allow the search tool crawler to browse and index the address given.
- **Disallow: **you will be blocking the content given

In order to validate the content, you must:

- Check whether the URLs listed really need some rule in the robots.txt file;
- Check whether the rules were correctly applied to the URLs intended;
- Verify if the sitemap.xml file was listed correctly.

robots.txt file editing for your store is available at: `[accountname].vtexcommercestable.com.br/admin/Site/ConfigSEOContents.aspx`.

For a proper setup of Search Console, the next steps are to check the store’s Sitemap; present the structure of your store to facilitate crawler browsing; and accelerate the indexation of pages.
