## Warehouse
It's the physical space used to store the goods of an e-commerce, functioning as the repository of the items of your store.

## Loading dock
It's a logistics stage that lies between the warehouse and the carriers. It functions as an outlet area for products that are coming from a distribution center.

## Shipping policies
It's the company responsible for distributing the products sold by an e-commerce.
