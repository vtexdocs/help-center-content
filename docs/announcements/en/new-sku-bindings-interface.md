VTEX allows your store to act both as a [seller](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-a-seller-on-vtex-marketplace--6g045OkRSjNpqhkExbQRlP) and as a [marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-vtex-marketplace--7splyp5MqIyt2Iyz5jsNzb), which allows you to reduce costs, reach more customers, and increase the variety of products you offer. In this context, each marketplace must establish and maintain a direct relationship between its catalog and the[ SKUs](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3mJbIqMlz6oKDmyZ2bKJoA) offered by sellers.

To improve this experience, we redesigned the **SKU Bindings** page in the VTEX Admin. The new interface allows you to track and manage the binding relationship between seller and marketplace SKUs in a simpler and more agile way.

## What has changed?

The **SKU Bindings** page has been completely redesigned. Check out the main changes:

- We introduced more accessible and optimized filters and search options.
- We created a new, simplified flow for binding or unbinding SKUs.
- We updated the page design to follow the _design system_ of the[ New VTEX Admin](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/?utm_source=announcement&utm_medium=help_center&utm_campaign=sku_bindings).

To view the page, log in to the VTEX Admin and go to **Marketplace > Sellers > SKU Bindings**.

## Why did we make this change?

We updated the page to simplify the experience of managing SKU bindings between marketplaces and sellers, making it easier for VTEX stores to act in third-party product sales scenarios.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. All stores will be automatically updated. You can return to the previous version of the experience at any time by clicking on the warning top of the new page.

For more information on how to leverage the interface, please refer to the article [SKU Bindings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sku-bindings--1SmrVgNwjJX17hdqwLa0TX).

This page follows the design of the [New VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/welcome-to-the-redesigned-vtex-admin--5tLPBodp6Xu03vYdyBTGTa), with a simpler, more modern and user-friendly look.
