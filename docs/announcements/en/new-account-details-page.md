VTEX is making available a new [account details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-da-conta--2vhUVOKfCaswqLguT2F9xq), which offers an intuitive and efficient experience for your operation.

## What has changed?

Your account information is divided into two tabs. The **General** tab contains the basic information of your account, company, and sponsor user, as well as related actions. The information and actions related to the stores linked to your account are available under the **Stores** tab.

Another change is that the new [account details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-da-conta--2vhUVOKfCaswqLguT2F9xq) doesn't include the **Security** section, which was part of the previous version. You can see the information and actions that were previously part of this section on the [app keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet#generating-app-keys-in-your-account) page, which is available for all VTEX accounts.

## What needs to be done?

The new [account details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-da-conta--2vhUVOKfCaswqLguT2F9xq) will be available for all accounts automatically. No action is necessary.

To learn how to access and use the new page, check the [account details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-da-conta--2vhUVOKfCaswqLguT2F9xq) documentation.

If you need to see the information and actions previously available in the **Security** section of the account details page, go to the [app keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet) page.
