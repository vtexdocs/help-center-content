The [integration](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-a-amazon) between VTEX stores and Amazon allows sellers to upload their product catalog to the marketplace to expand their sales channels. Now, we have expanded the integration to support Amazon's [FBA Classic (Fulfillment by Amazon)](https://venda.amazon.com.br/cresca/fba) and [DBA (Delivery by Amazon)](https://venda.amazon.com.br/cresca/dba) logistics programs. The new feature for [importing orders from FBA Classic or DBA](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/importacao-de-pedidos-amazon-fba-dba) allows users to view and manage orders in a single place.

## What has changed?

Before this feature was released, the VTEX–Amazon integration could not receive orders from FBA Classic and DBA programs. As of January 25, 2023, VTEX sellers participating in at least one of Amazon's programs will have visibility into FBA Classic and DBA orders in the VTEX Admin, in **Order Management (Orders > All Orders)**.  

Now, sellers using FBA Classic can perform the following actions in the VTEX Admin:

-	Configure new products in FBA Classic via [product specification](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/importacao-de-pedidos-amazon-fba-dba--2MJZgBen3hpK4xkXqcv8TO?&utm_source=autocomplete#1-criar-especificacao-de-produto).
-	Track order progress.  

Sellers using DBA have access to the following features:

-	Track order progress.  
-	Invoice orders.  
-	Issue order labels.  

## Why did we make this change?

We have improved the integration with Amazon to allow VTEX sellers to:

-	Manage orders placed on the marketplace in one place.  
-	Have a more comprehensive experience in the VTEX Admin.  
-	Optimize order management operational work.  

## What needs to be done?

Every seller using the [native](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/integrando-com-marketplace/) VTEX–Amazon [integration](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/integrando-com-marketplace/) can benefit from this improvement with no additional cost associated with VTEX. To enable the VTEX Admin feature, you have to register and configure one of the options in Amazon [Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/). Then follow the instructions on the [FBA Classic or DBA Order Import](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/importacao-de-pedidos-amazon-fba-dba) page.
