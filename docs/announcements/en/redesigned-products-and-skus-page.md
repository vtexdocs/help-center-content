---

Catalog management is key to a successful ecommerce website, as the product window display allows customers to interact with the brand and make purchase decisions. Therefore, retailers need to have a consistent and agile experience when viewing, adding, and editing information about products and SKUs.

With this in mind, we have redesigned the **Catalog > Products & SKUs** page to provide an enhanced Catalog management experience. The interface is available in Beta for stores using the [New VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/pt/announcements/bem-vindo-ao-novo-admin-vtex--5tLPBodp6Xu03vYdyBTGTa). 

## What has changed?

The new **Products & SKUs** interface allows you to:

* Access your store's full list of products and SKUs with a more modern and intuitive design, updated for the [New VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/pt/announcements/bem-vindo-ao-novo-admin-vtex--5tLPBodp6Xu03vYdyBTGTa).
* Find products faster with optimized search and easy-to-use filters.
* Track product and SKU status in a more straightforward and visual way, with icons and SKU status in the list.
* Easily identify products and SKUs with pending information waiting to be available for sale through the new **Pending** status.
