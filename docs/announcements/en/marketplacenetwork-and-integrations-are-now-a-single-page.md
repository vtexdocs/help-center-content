announcementSynopsisEN: We have unified the Marketplace Network and the Integrations module; now, they are Marketplaces and Integrations.
---

To unify the opportunities to connect to VTEX and external marketplaces, we have merged the Integrations and Marketplace Network pages, now called __Marketplaces and Integrations__. The update will be available in all VTEX accounts as of May 03, 2023.  

![Marketplaces and Integrations](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/6O436Pjv91m3GWuWFsmeAD/e4382e0c375781f8f1029ffe29e6738a/Captura_de_tela_2023-04-17_110739.png)

## What has changed?  

Previously, if the seller wanted to connect to an external marketplace, they would go to Marketplace > Connections > Integrations. If they wanted to connect to a VTEX marketplace, they would go to Marketplace > Marketplace Network > Find Marketplaces to contact a VTEX marketplace.  

Now, sellers can find VTEX and external marketplaces to connect to or edit existing connections on a single page. To access the new page, sellers need to go to Marketplace > Connections > Marketplaces and Integrations.  

## Why did we make this change?  

We have unified the modules in Marketplaces and Integrations to provide VTEX sellers with the following:  

- A centralized view of marketplaces available for integration.  
- The industry and the country in which each marketplace operates.  
- Filters by integration type.  

## What needs to be done?  

This update will be automatically available to all VTEX users as of May 03, 2023. Learn more about the page in the [Marketplaces and Integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/marketplaces-e-integracoes--5AcBO1t29nhq7rBHas9b6V) documentation.
