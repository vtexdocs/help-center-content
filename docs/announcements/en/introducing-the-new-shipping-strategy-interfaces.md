Starting from May 31st, we are launching for all VTEX stores the beta version of the new **Shipping Strategy** interfaces, which consist of the [Shipping Policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140), [Loading Docks](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/doca--5DY8xHEjOLYDVL41Urd5qj), and [Warehouses](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estoque--6oIxvsVDTtGpO7y6zwhGpb) pages.

The **Shipping Strategy** pages have been updated according to the new VTEX design system, as shown below:

## What has changed?

The new interfaces offer a more intuitive experience and have been updated for the VTEX Admin. Additionally, the following improvements have been made to the **Shipping Policies** page:

* **New activation flow:** You can easily activate or deactivate your [shipping policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140) by choosing the desired option in the menu <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> in the shipping policy row.
* **Easily track information:** You can easily track the relationship between your shipping policies and loading docks, having more visibility of your operation.

## Why did we make this change?

We have streamlined the **Shipping Strategy** pages to ensure a more consistent, intuitive, and efficient experience.

## What needs to be done?

Starting from May 31st, the beta version of **Shipping Strategy** is available for all VTEX stores. To take part in the new experience, in your VTEX Admin, go to **Shipping > Shipping Strategy** and click `Test the beta version!` in the banner.

After testing it, if you wish to go back to the previous version, click the menu <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> at the top of the page, select `Switch to Previous Version` and give us some feedback. The return to the previous experience will be automatic.
