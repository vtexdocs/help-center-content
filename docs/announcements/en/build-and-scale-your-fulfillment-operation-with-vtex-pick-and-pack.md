## What has changed?

Previously, merchants did not have a single place connected to VTEX Admin's processes and data to manage picking, packing, and last-mile delivery - and this lack of visibility on the fulfillment process made it difficult to identify problems in their operational process.

Picking and packing processes usually involved several manual actions from the merchant’s side, which was inefficient and often resulted in errors, broken promises to customers and higher fulfillment costs.

**VTEX Pick and Pack** allows merchants to seamlessly manage the picking, packing, and last-mile delivery of orders in a single place.

The solution is a combination of:

- **VTEX Fulfillment:** The store operator can communicate with pickers and manage picking and packing, and also track real-time data about orders, pickers' performance and store's fulfillment rate. Pickers can scan items using their mobile devices and, when allowed, they can communicate with customers and make order changes: changing prices, and also replacing, removing and adding items. Changes in orders are supported via Change Order API.    
- **Last Mile:** Store operators can manage and instruct delivery drivers about collecting and delivering orders. It includes route optimization and proof of collecting/delivering. Besides, your store can easily integrate with external carriers or a TMS. It also includes a URL where shoppers can track their orders' status in real time.   
- **Mobile apps:** Apps for mobile devices meant exclusively for pickers and drivers, so that they accomplish their tasks with no access to the store’s Admin. Currently, the apps are available only for Android devices.
