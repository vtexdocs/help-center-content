inStore is one of VTEX's main products for unified commerce operations. It’s an app that allows your store to provide a true omnichannel experience, integrating your online and physical channels and placing your customers at the core of the business.

Now, your physical store’s sales associates can use filters when searching for products on inStore if they have [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG) enabled. With this feature, searching inStore's endless aisle will become a more dynamic and precise process, speeding up sales.

## What has changed?

Previously, VTEX Intelligent Search filters were not available in inStore, only in ecommerce.

With the new feature, when searching for a term, sales associates can filter results by price range, department, and brand, for example, among other configurable filters in VTEX Intelligent Search. This allows them to quickly find the desired product.

## Why did we make this change?

This feature is intended to improve the inStore endless aisle search experience, to facilitate sales in physical stores and support a unified commerce strategy.

## What needs to be done?

To use the search filters on inStore's endless aisle, you must install and configure [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG). In this context, please note that:

* It is essential to configure the filters that will be displayed, as indicated in the article [Search configuration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/5t75L6lYNwix93l41s1Yrx). Otherwise, all product information will be considered as filterable attributes in inStore.
* The **Autocomplete** option does not apply to the inStore search, so it can be left blank.
* Any changes made to the search settings will also apply to the ecommerce if the tool used is VTEX Intelligent Search.

In addition to configuring VTEX Intelligent Search, it is necessary to [contact VTEX support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) to enable the filter feature in inStore.
