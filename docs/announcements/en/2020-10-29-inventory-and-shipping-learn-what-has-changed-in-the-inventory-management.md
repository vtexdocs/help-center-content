You can manage all of your store’s logistics in the Inventory & Shipping module. The number of items available in your inventory can be checked and updated in the "Inventory" tab. In order to improve the module experience, we have updated it.

## What has changed?
The design of the **Inventory** tab, in the Inventory & shipping module, will be updated on October 29, 2020. Besides optimizing the interface usability, we have changed the name of the tab to **Inventory management**. 

Previously, your inventory items were only displayed once you applied filters by product, SKU, or inventory availability. Also, to update the number of items in stock, you had to go to the Update Inventory page, which made the process less smooth.

With the new design of the Inventory management interface, all items in stock are already displayed and you can update their quantity on the same page. Now you can:

- Search for specific products and SKUs.  
- Filter SKUs by reserved and available statuses, or by warehouse.  
- Check the number of items in stock for each SKU.  
- Manually update the number of items in stock.  
- Set infinite inventory for specific SKUs.  
- View inventory update history.  

## What has changed in my store?

The tab’s design has been improved, but the configuration fields have not changed. All the information previously contained in your *Inventory* tab remains the same. No configuration is required.
