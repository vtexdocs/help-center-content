A critical part of a B2B operation is the segmentation of prices and rates according to the buying company profile. The rules change from store to store, but factors such as the buyer's location, type of order and payment method can directly affect the price and taxes applicable to the sale.

Aiming to make this experience better for the buying company and simplify the configuration of these rules for you, we are launching the __B2B Order Configuration__ application.

### How does it work?
From now on, you can combine rules and [price tables](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-price-tables--58YmY2Iwggyw4WeSCGg24S "Creating Price Tables") previously created in our system with new segmentation criteria based on the type of order to instantly display the updated prices to customers during the purchase experience.

This way, we are providing new tools to segment prices and a new component in your store layout. To make all of this possible, we divided the solution into two parts: 

- A new __price segmentation configuration__ service (API), in which you can set the criteria of influence and match them with the correct price tables;  
- The __order configuration__ component (app), which during the purchase experience will display the required fields for the buying company to configure its order and have access to the prices that are valid for it.

Both pillars are crucial because, apart from creating more refined rules that reflect your business strategies, you ensure that your B2B customer's purchase experience will be the best possible.

### Main benefits
This new application allows you to:

- Have greater control over price segmentation strategies;
- Adjust the purchase flow according to your business rules;
- Simplify the online purchase experience, creating a real self-service B2B purchase experience;

### Ready to start?
Clients who use the VTEX Store Framework can easily install the B2B Order Configuration App through our App Store. All capabilities are also available via API for clients with stores in the Portal.

Regardless of the version of your store, check [our documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-order-configuration--2t6UQoFrFSSGW8CGEbA0r5 "What is Order Configuration") to see how to start using the B2B Order Configuration app in your store.
