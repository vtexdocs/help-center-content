Content marketing has been heavily used as a marketing tool. WordPress is an open source software with which you can freely create a website or blog containing pages and posts (categorized or not) about your brand and products.

With the new [WordPress integration app](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-wordpress-integration/p), stores developed with VTEX IO can incorporate pages, posts and categories published on websites and/or blogs developed on WordPress.

## What changed? 

Stores developed with VTEX IO can now display pages and posts (as well as their categories) from your brand's blog/website within the store.

## Why did we make this change? 

Integrating your blog/website into the store is equal to using a powerful content marketing tool that can, for example, leverage sales, help increase engagement, reach and recognition, in addition to building a community for the brand.

##  What needs to be done? 

Install the app from the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-wordpress-integration/p) and follow the instructions in [this documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-wordpress-integration) to configure the integration.
