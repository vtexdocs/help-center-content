The VTEX Admin currently supports different languages. We localize our product to improve the customer experience, not only by translating our platform, but also by taking into account the particularities of each country.

## What has changed?
As of October 2021, VTEX users will find a tenth language option in the Admin. In addition to Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Japanese, Dutch, French, and Korean, the platform can now be used in Bulgarian.

## Why did we make this change?
The localization of the Admin into Bulgarian was driven by the goal of better serving the local market, catering to our clients in the Eastern European region. 

## What needs to be done?
To view the VTEX Admin in Bulgarian, select __BG__ from the language dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen.

While we currently don’t offer documentation in Bulgarian, you can access [VTEX Community in your native language](https://community.vtex.com/c/vtex-in-your-native-language/10).
