We have developed improvements for the **Payments** module to enhance your shopping experience. With additional features, we offer more convenience, security, and cost reduction. 

## What has changed?

 With the aim of improving the customers' shopping experience, we introduce new functionalities to the Payments module. Check out the main improvements:

* **Gateway is ready to allow buyer email exchange:** along with other VTEX modules, the Gateway is now adapted so that the buyer can change the email saved in their store account.
* **Implementation of partial captures:** available for stores to use partial capture. All transactions with splits will "wait" for the complete transaction to take capture actions, which means cost reduction for the merchant. Learn more in the [Partial Invoices](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/pedidos--2xkTisx4SXOWXQel8Jg8sa/q9GPspTb9cHlMeAZfdEUe) article.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required since the updates will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores.
