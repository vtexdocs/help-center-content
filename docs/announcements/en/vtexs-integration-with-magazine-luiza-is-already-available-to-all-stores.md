Now you don't have to depend on external integrations to sell on Magazine Luiza.  In partnership with the marketplace (one of the biggest in Brazil), we've developed a  new solution, which replaces the old integrations used by our clients.


## How was the process
Our integration with Magazine Luiza became available in October 2018, but only for stores that weren't connected to the marketplace yet. In early December,  we started the migration process of stores that were operating with external integrations.  It all went down smoothly, with no action required on client side.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Magazine Luiza's integration occurs through  Integra Commerce's system, which intermediates the information sent by VTEX and repasses them to the marketplace.

## Complete, stable, and with our team's full support
 The new integration brings a lot more advantages to your store:

- Manage all orders from Magazine Luiza right through VTEX's Admin.
- Treat errors without leaving our platform.
- Solve problems (diverging prices, for example) and recover sales that would otherwise get lost in the flow.
- Get help from our Support Team by opening tickets with your questions about the integration.
- And be sure that VTEX's development team is continually improving the solution and its features.
