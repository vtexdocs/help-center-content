You requested it, and we got it: your store can now make the wishlist functionality available to end customers! Boost customer engagement and increase your sales by allowing customers to create desired products collections for future purchase.

## What are the capabilities?

- Adding a heart icon next to each product in the product lists and product detail pages;
- Creating a Wishlist page, where customers can see their favorite items and easily purchase them.
