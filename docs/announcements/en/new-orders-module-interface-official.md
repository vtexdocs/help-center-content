The VTEX Admin **All Orders** module was redesigned for a more intuitive and complete experience and was in beta. Therefore, you could switch back to the previous interface version.

As of February 1st, 2023, the new **All Orders** module interface will be made official for all VTEX stores globally. For those still using the old experience, please read the [FAQ](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/perguntas-frequentes-nova-interface-modulo-pedidos--1mgSrqT2X3lxIkccEv8bLW) article, which covers some of the main questions that may arise. 

Along with this change, the official version of the interface comes with new features, such as the [no-date limit order search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/filtrar-todos-pedidos--tutorials_192), which allows you to search all orders, regardless of their creation date. Seeing the order diagram is also possible now. 

## What has changed?

The new interface, which will be official as of February 1st, has two main new features compared to the beta version:

* **No-date limit order search:** You can search for orders without setting a date limit, which returns all orders related to the criteria used, regardless of the order creation date. This search cannot be combined with other filters. However, you can select a custom search period of up to 6 months and then combine it with the filters. Learn more in the article [Filter orders on All orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/filtrar-todos-pedidos--tutorials_192).

* **Order diagram:** In the _Order status_ section of the new interface, by default, a timeline with the events of the order is displayed. Now you can also see the _Order diagram_. When you click `View diagram`, a modal opens and displays the following image:

For those not using the beta version yet, the image below maps the  fields between the old and new versions of the **Order Details** page:

## Why did we make this change?

The goal of updating the stores with the new order interface is to offer a more intuitive and complete experience on the VTEX platform and be compatible with the [New VTEX Admin](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/) design system. 

The official version's new features enhance the order management experience by allowing searching for orders with no date limit and viewing the order diagram.

## What needs to be done?

As of February 1st, 2023, all VTEX stores globally will be automatically updated with the new **All Orders** module interface, and no action is required. 

As of this date, you will not be able to switch back to the old interface version. For those not using the beta version yet, some of the main questions you may have about the transition have been covered in the [FAQ about the new orders module interface](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/perguntas-frequentes-nova-interface-modulo-pedidos--1mgSrqT2X3lxIkccEv8bLW).
