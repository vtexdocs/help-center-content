announcementSynopsisEN: 'Resource discontinuation extended to October 7th, 2019'
---

At the beginning of September we have started a campaign aimed at supporting our clients with the Master Data front-end requirements adaptation process, which will no longer support __CORS__ (Cross-Origin-Resource Sharing).

Aligning this with the partnership we have with our clients and ensuring the least amount of friction possible to your operations, we have extended this resource's **discontinuation date** to **October 7th, 2019**.

Ask your store's front-end admin for help and count on our support in providing you with detailed information that will help you validate and solve this endeavor. 

VTEX thanks you for your support with this process while continuously striving for an increasingly reliable and complete experience for you and your customers!
