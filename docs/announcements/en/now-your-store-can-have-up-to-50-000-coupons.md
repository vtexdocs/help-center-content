announcementSynopsisEN: The coupons API received an update, significantly increasing your store's coupon creation potential.
---

The coupons API was updated on __July 12__, increasing the capacity to generate coupons. Before the update, you could only create as few as 5,000 coupons. Now, you can generate up to __50,000__.


## What has changed
To increase the number of coupons, we had to make a few adjustments in the API. From now on, coupons' codes can't include special characters: Letters, numbers, and hyphens are the only ones allowed. Additionally, the `Coupon ID` has been replaced by the coupon code itself, changing the API's endpoint for a single coupon.


## What you need to do
Nothing, actually. The API's endpoints and usability remain the same. All the old coupons are now following the new rules. Although unlikely, you may find there's a coupon missing. In that case, you'll have to generate a new one.
