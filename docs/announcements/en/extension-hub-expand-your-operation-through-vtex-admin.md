announcementSynopsisEN: The new VTEX Admin section to find partners, add features and manage extensions
---

Extensions Hub is a new section of VTEX Admin that gathers partner developers and merchants who want to expand their operation capabilities. Through Extensions Hub, partners can publish extensions, and merchants can view, purchase, install, and manage them. Extensions Hub will be available globally in all VTEX stores during the third quarter (Q3) of 2023. If you want to enable Extensions Hub in your store immediately, you can request it by [opening a ticket to our support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM).

## What has changed?

The Extensions Hub introduces the concept of extensions, which are tools designed to expand the VTEX platform operation. Extensions include VTEX IO apps, payment connectors, marketplace integrations, and others.

The Extensions Hub is a new VTEX Admin section composed of three pages: **App Store**, **Partners**, and **App Management**.

### App Store

With Extensions Hub, the entire navigation and app purchasing experience happens seamlessly inside the VTEX Admin. You can easily find, buy and install apps with a few clicks without leaving the Admin.

The **App Store** displays prices in US dollars (USD) for stores all over the world, and in Brazilian reais (BRL) for stores in Brazil. Payments for app purchases, subscriptions, and usage are processed automatically, and the corresponding amounts are added to your [VTEX invoice](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/billing-overview--6UxfCl4fw4GmyQwoUuIcQs) in your local currency, eliminating the need for credit card payment. If your operation is located outside Brazil and your invoice is in a currency other than USD, we will convert the USD amount to your local currency.

<div class = "alert alert-info">
The <a href="http://apps.vtex.com/">App Store website</a> will still exist for viewing apps in a public way, but it will no longer support app purchases. Purchases can only be made through the VTEX Admin.

### Partners

We have integrated the whole experience of the [Partner Portal website](https://partnerportal.vtex.com/) into the new Extensions Hub page, which makes it easier to find partners for your business and unify the experience with platform extensions. You can search for partners through the new **Partners** page, get details about them, and make initial contact directly from the VTEX Admin.

The [Partner Portal website](https://partnerportal.vtex.com/) will remain unchanged.

### App Management

**App Management** is the new name for the **My Apps** page. It still provides the same functionalities: install, uninstall, remove, and configure apps. The page has been moved to the Extensions Hub to unify the experiences of buying and managing apps. We have also updated the interface of the page following the design pattern of the [new VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/welcome-to-the-redisigned-vtex-admin--428AanFpOiQgRkaLvDHVO9).

## What needs to be done?

Extensions Hub will be available for all stores in the third quarter (Q3) of 2023. If you want to enable Extensions Hub in your store immediately, you can request it by [opening a ticket to our support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM). Then, to start using the Extensions Hub, access it in your Admin. On the VTEX Admin left side menu, click the **Extensions** icon, and the Extensions Hub will be visible at the top of the menu.

## Why did we make this change?

By bringing the **App Store** and **Partner Portal** into the VTEX Admin and making the changes using the **App Management**, we have created a unified extension experience within the VTEX Admin through the Extensions Hub.

Additionally, we have redesigned the app shopping experience in the **App Store**. With just a few clicks, you can find, buy and install apps without leaving the VTEX Admin or worrying about payment details. This new experience is more integrated with the usage and management of apps, allowing you to add features to your store much faster.

Finally, our goal is to strengthen the relationship between merchants and VTEX partners. Thus, merchants who want to implement unique store solutions can now directly find and contact partners and developers through the **Partners** page in the VTEX Admin.
