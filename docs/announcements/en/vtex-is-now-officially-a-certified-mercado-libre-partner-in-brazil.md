Mercado Libre is one of the leaders in ecommerce in Latin America. It offers ecommerce solutions for buying, selling, paying for, advertising, and shipping products online for end-users and businesses.

VTEX is now a certified Mercado Libre integration partner!

The certification ensures that the VTEX integration has reached the standards of excellence required by Mercado Libre. In practice, the certification ensures that the solution is adapted to [omnichannel](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv) and has the necessary features for the seller to succeed in their sales operation on Mercado Libre.

Here are some of the benefits provided by the certification:

- **Specialized support from the Mercado Libre team:** with the certification, VTEX has access to more agile and specialized support from the Mercado Libre team.
- **Certified partner badge:** Mercado Libre performs a series of validations to ensure that the integration supports its main features. Therefore, having the certified partner badge is a guarantee for our clients that VTEX offers a solution that will meet their needs.
- **Certified VTEX team:** the VTEX team that developed the solution was also certified through a validation that proves our extensive knowledge of Mercado Libre's open platform, improving the integration maintenance.
