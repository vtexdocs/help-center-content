Offering subscriptions is a way to build loyalty and retain the audience that makes frequent purchases in your store. VTEX's solution for this type of strategy is the [Subscriptions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-a-assinatura--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453) app, which allows you to create subscription plans that automatically generate recurring orders.

To make the installation process easier, we have launched the Subscriptions  app for free on the VTEX App Store. Now, with only a few clicks, you can install the app and use all its features.

## What has changed?

Previously, you had to send a request to VTEX Support to install the app. You can now install the Subscriptions app directly from the VTEX App Store.

## Why did we make this change?

The app is now available on the VTEX App Store to expand access to this feature and make the installation process more agile and autonomous.

## What needs to be done?

To start offering the subscriptions feature in your store, install the [Subscriptions](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-admin-subscriptions/p) app from the VTEX App Store and configure it by following the[ How to configure Subscriptions in your store](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-configurar-assinaturas--1FA9dfE7vJqxBna9Nft5Sj) guide.

No action is needed for stores already using the Subscriptions app.
