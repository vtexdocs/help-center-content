With VTEX's __New Admin__, you stay up to date on all things VTEX without leaving the platform. The alert icon in the top bar will let you know whenever a new announcement comes out. And more: alerts come in different colors, so you can easily identify if they're about a new feature or a major change.

Besides that, announcements now have their own module in the __New Admin__. A way to highlight the latest news even more and make you find out if a changelog will affect your store or not. That will give the time you need to take action and keep delivering the best shopping experience to your customers.
