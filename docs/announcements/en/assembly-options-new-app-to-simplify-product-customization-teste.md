Customizing products is a common need in the online shopping experience. On the VTEX platform, you can customize products using [Assembly Options](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/assembly-options--5x5FhNr4f5RUGDEGWzV1nH) — [attachments](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-an-attachment--aGICk0RVbqKg6GYmQcWUm) for complex scenarios in which you need to manage different combinations of products, quantities, additional items and costs.

For example, restaurants that accept online orders usually allow customers to choose ingredients and add extra items to their orders.

To simplify this feature, we developed the Assembly Options app, which provides an interface for configuring and managing custom options. The app is only available for stores using [VTEX IO](https://vtex.com/us-en/store-framework/).

## What has changed?

Previously, you had to create Assembly Options manually in **Products > Catalog > Attachments**, as described in [Implementing Assembly Options](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/assembly-options--5x5FhNr4f5RUGDEGWzV1nH).

With the new app, you can now configure Assembly Options by accessing **Products > Assembly Options** in the VTEX Admin, using a more straightforward and specific interface.

## Why did we make this change?

We developed the Assembly Options app to allow retailers to provide product customization options in a streamlined and easy way, using their interface for this feature.

## What needs to be done?

The Assembly Options app is only available for stores developed using [VTEX IO](https://vtex.com/us-en/store-framework/). To use it, you also need to [install and configure the Product Customizer](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-product-customizer) in your store.

You can install the app for free from the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-admin-assembly-options/p) or via [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference) by following the steps in the [Assembly Options app guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/assembly-options-app) for developers. After installation, the **Products > Assembly Options** page will become available in the VTEX Admin.

For more details on using this app in VTEX Admin, check out the article [Assembly Options app](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/assembly-options-app--54mWg37mojrqOgCA79iqqk).
