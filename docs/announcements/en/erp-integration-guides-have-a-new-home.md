As part of our ongoing effort of developer documentation migration to our Developer Portal, we have recently created a new [ERP integration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-guide) detailing how to use our API endpoints to:

- Set up catalog
- Import products
- Import prices
- Import inventory
- Set up order integration
- Set up order processing
- Set up invoicing and tracking

This brand new documentation uses the new [Catalog REST API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/catalog-api-overview) and replaces our prior guide that used the Webservice SOAP API, which is no longer available in our Help Center.

<div class="alert alert-warning">We have not yet deprecated the Webservice SOAP API, but it is no longer recommended for new integrations.</div>
