 VTEX is launching a new feature that allows buying organizations (B2B) to select an exclusive group of sellers to fulfill their purchase orders.

## What has changed?

Now, each buying organization will be able to determine which sellers can display products to their customers during the purchasing process.

## Why did we make this change?

To enable a more streamlined, centralized buying experience that gives buyers direct access to the products of selected sellers.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The feature is available for all stores.
For more information on how to create a new seller allocation, read the [Configuring seller allocation for buying organizations (B2B)](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/configurando-atribuicao-de-sellers-a-organizacoes-compradoras-b2b-xky--3VJtKNbLpVAl71uVdaOqpE) article.
