announcementSynopsisEN: New version of inStore Setup now provides automatic settings
---

To provide a more approachable and simplified [inStore Setup](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-instore/p) onboarding process, we have developed a new app version that automatically enables some settings.

## What has changed?

Previously, users had to contact VTEX support to activate some inStore settings. In the new version, we improved the following:

* [Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG) installation is now provided by default, allowing filters and boosting search performance.
* [Social Selling](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-usando-o-app--4BYzQIwyOHvnmnCYQgLzdr/6deiffo22iKkY27PkfstXy) installation is also provided by default, allowing sellers using inStore to sell through the ecommerce store checkout.
* Payment methods Pix (Brazil) and PagarMe (Brazil) are now automatically configured.

## Why did we make this change?

Our goal is to provide our clients with an easier and more seamless onboarding process by eliminating the need for contacting support to enable these features. This update also allows the client to complete the inStore installation and process payments using the methods available on the ecommerce or physical store.

## What needs to be done?

New stores require no action, as the update will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores using inStore.

If you want to implement these features in an existing store, please contact [our support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us).
