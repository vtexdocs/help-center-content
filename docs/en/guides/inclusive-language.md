## Diversity

Inclusive language isn’t just about avoiding certain words; it’s about adopting a thoughtful approach to writing that respects diversity, avoids assumptions and stereotypes, and fosters understanding by acknowledging people’s identities and experiences.

## Writing principles

Our language should reflect the diversity of our community and the unique identities of those we serve. Here are some principles to help you craft inclusive, respectful, and welcoming experiences through your writing.

* **When talking to people**, be respectful of all people. Use language that considers their perspectives and experiences.  
* **When talking about people**, be descriptive only when required by the context.  
* **When talking about things**, use clear and accurate information, avoiding metaphors and idioms that could obscure meaning.

Avoid using terms that may carry unconscious racial bias or those associated with military actions, politics, or sensitive historical events. These terms can inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or create discomfort.

| ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>Protect your data against potential threats.</li><li>We respond to cybersecurity risks to ensure your system’s safety.</li><li>Our solution helps safeguard your network.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Fight against cyberattacks.</li><li>Defend your systems from the enemy.</li><li>Go on the offensive with our security tools.</li></ul> |

## Gender-neutral language

You can use the singular **they** as a generic third-person singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context. Alternatively, using **you** is also a neutral option. The subject-verb agreement will follow the English grammar rules, i.e.: you are, they are, and so on.

Don't use *he, him, his, she, her*, or *hers* in generic references.

You can also use a writing resource throughout the text to improve readability, such as using “customers” and “they” instead of “a customer” and “they”, if the context does not require the subject in the singular form.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>If a customer has questions about their order, **they** can contact our support team for assistance.</li><li>When customers want to return an order, **they are** able to do that through physical stores.</li><li>This feature allows sales associates to showcase products in real time, allowing **them** to replicate an in-person experience with the customer.</li></ul> | <ul><li>If a customer has questions about their order, **he/she** can contact our support team for assistance.</li><li>When customers want to return an order, **he or she is** able to do that through physical stores.</li><li>This feature allows sales associates to showcase products in real time, allowing **he or she** to replicate an in-person experience with the customer.</li></ul> |

When referring to example user profiles, use names that reflect a broad range of identities.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>Maria</li><li>Jamal</li></ul> | <ul><li>James</li><li>Jessica</li></ul> |

## Describing people

When describing a group of people, use language that reflects how they describe themselves.

If you're unsure, use person-first language, which focuses on the person before their traits. For example, say "people with disabilities" instead of "disabled people." However, some groups may prefer identity-first language, like the Deaf community, who often use "deaf person" to emphasize their identity as part of a cultural group.

| Good | Better | Reason |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>Dark mode is useful for people with vision issues.</li><li>The policy was designed with feedback from people of Hispanic or Latino origin.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Dark mode is useful for people who prefer reduced screen brightness.</li><li>The policy was designed with feedback from Mexican and Colombian communities.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Not everyone who uses dark mode has vision issues. This description is broader and applies to more users.</li><li>Being specific highlights the unique experiences of distinct cultural groups within broader terms like "Hispanic" or "Latino”.</li></ul> |

**To create inclusive content:**

* Focus on individuals, not their conditions or limitations.  
* Use straightforward language, and steer clear of metaphors, euphemisms, or idiomatic expressions.  
* Avoid words that are misinterpreted as microaggressions.  
* Refrain from using terms related to disabilities to describe objects, features, or experiences.

| Usage | Reason |
| ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>Terms related to sight, such as "View all products," and "Watch the meeting."</li></ul> | <ul><li>People who are blind or have low vision are not excluded by these terms — they still "view" content, just in a different way. Where possible, use alternatives to these words, but only if it makes sense in context. You don’t need to eliminate them if they accurately describe the action.</li></ul> |
| <ul><li>Enabled/disabled</li></ul> | <ul><li>"Disabled" isn’t inherently offensive; it refers to when individuals face limitations due to their environment or societal barriers. However, it’s important to avoid associating "disabled" with negative or undesirable states.</li></ul> |

Where appropriate, we recommend: 

* Not using label actions or features using “disable” or “disabled.” 

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>Turn off</li><li>Inactive</li><li>Deactivate</li></ul> | <ul><li>Disable</li><li>Disabled</li></ul> |

## Deaf

Only use this term to refer to actual deafness, not as a metaphor. Use lowercase unless referring to the Deaf community.

## Handicap, handicapped

Don’t use this term to refer to someone’s disability. Be specific:

| Do ✅ |
| ---- |
| <ul><li>Person who requires a keyboard-accessible checkout.</li><li>Person who uses an accessibility device.</li><li>Shopper with accessibility requirements.</li><li>User who requires assistive technology.</li></ul> |

## Blind

Only use this term to reference actual blindness, not as a metaphor.

## Insane, crazy

Avoid using these words to describe something as extreme or unbelievable.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| ---- | ---- |
| <ul><li>Some surprising trends emerged in the sales data this quarter.</li><li>Before launching the promotion, carefully review the discount settings to avoid errors.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Some crazy trends showed up in the sales data this quarter.</li><li>Before launching the promotion, do a quick sanity check on the discount settings.</li></ul> |

## Race

* Treat perspectives that differ from your own with curiosity and respect, avoiding language that might label them as unusual or unfamiliar.  
* Use neutral language and avoid associating terms like “black” or “dark” with negative connotations or “white” or “light” with positive ones.  
* Be mindful of metaphors and idioms, as some may carry unintended historical or cultural biases.

## Regions

Be mindful when referring to different parts of the world. If you mention cities, countries, or regions in examples, ensure they are not politically disputed. When discussing multiple regions, use equivalent references to avoid unintended bias.
