We've created this feature to access and export FBA order invoices easily, allowing you to customize searches with more precision. The feature is available for all VTEX clients who operate as sellers through the [integration with Amazon](/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-a-amazon--6sgd4Pagy3wNsWKBvmIFrP/5sYA9MlRo92jJIxKF1MTXb) and have FBA orders.  

## What has changed?

Previously, sellers could only access this information through Amazon Seller Central. Now, you can find it directly through the VTEX Admin. To access it, go to **Admin > Marketplace > Amazon > Invoices.** On this page, you can apply filters to customize your search and export only the desired details.  

## Why did we make this change?

We've developed this new feature to streamline seller processes and centralize the management of FBA order invoices. Here are the main benefits:

- Easy export of FBA order invoices directly from the VTEX Admin.  
- Customizable filters by period, status, and type.  

## What needs to be done?

This feature is available to all VTEX accounts integrated with Amazon. To start using it, see the instructions in the tutorial [FBA order invoices](/en/tutorial/notas-fiscais-de-pedidos-fba--5ok71vWueJ22JhXo1egx2y).
