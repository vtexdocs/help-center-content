You can now export findings from [Security Monitor](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/security-monitor--5LOVNLrrtmgSj99pM1NS4x) to a CSV file. With this new feature, merchants have more control to record, share, and further analyze security risks detected in their accounts.

## What has changed?

We've added the option to export findings directly from the Security Monitor dashboard. Now, you can export the findings as a CSV file, making it easier to use the data outside the VTEX platform.  

Go to **Dashboards > Security Monitor > Security Monitor Dashboard** and click `Export` in the top right corner of the screen. You can select which findings to include in the exported file: *All findings*, *Open*, *Snoozed*, or *Closed*. Learn more in [Security Monitor](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/security-monitor--5LOVNLrrtmgSj99pM1NS4x).

## Why did we make this change?

This improvement helps track security findings more effectively and supports integration with external monitoring or audit tools.

## What needs to be done?

The update is available for all accounts using Security Monitor. No action is required.
