VTEX is launching the new [Operational Capacity (Beta)](/en/tutorial/operational-capacity-beta--2thSYLMAS8KAd8V4XuBLSy) module, designed to help retailers manage the capacity of [sellers](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-um-seller--5FkLvhZ3Few4CWWIuYOK2w) to receive and handle orders. This tool allows you to monitor order distribution among sellers and make adjustments to optimize operational flow, promoting a more efficient logistics network.
