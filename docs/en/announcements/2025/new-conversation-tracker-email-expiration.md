To improve the VTEX customer experience, the expiration time of the Conversation Tracker's alternate email address has been shortened. This change adds an extra layer of security.

## What has changed?
Previously, the [Conversation Tracker's](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-the-conversation-tracker--tutorials_195) alternate email address remained valid for two months after placing the order. Now, the email address expires when the order reaches the end of the flow — when it's invoiced or canceled.

> ℹ️ VTEX may send emails related to orders after they’ve been invoiced, such as refunds or delivery status updates. In these cases, VTEX will temporarily reactivate the email address, send the email, and then expire it again.

## What needs to be done?
No action is needed. The email address expiration update has been automatically applied to all VTEX stores.
