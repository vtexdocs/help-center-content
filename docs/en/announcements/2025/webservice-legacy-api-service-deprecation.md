---

As of **September 1, 2025**, the Webservice API will be permanently deprecated on the VTEX platform. Therefore, clients using this legacy service must migrate their operations to the current set of VTEX APIs â€” see our [API Reference](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference).

Additionally, VTEX clients who don't use the Webservice API will immediately lose access to this service.

## What has changed?

The Webservice API is a technology that uses an obsolete protocol, which limits the performance of our clients' operations.

The VTEX platform has evolved, offering [REST APIs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference) that use updated protocols and provide better and more secure conditions for store operations. In other words, our current API reference covers all scenarios supported by the Webservice API and provides additional options.

## What needs to be done?

If your store has an integration that uses the Webservice API, you must adapt it to use our [REST APIs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference) instead. The deadline for this migration is **September 1, 2025**, when the service will be permanently deactivated. Merchants must make the necessary changes before the deadline.

For clients who don't use the Webservice API, this deprecation will have no impact, but it's no longer possible to request access to this service.
