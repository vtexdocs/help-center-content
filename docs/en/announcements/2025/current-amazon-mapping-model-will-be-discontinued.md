In order to provide the best experience for our clients, we're announcing the discontinuation of the **Amazon mapper** and ** Spreadsheet mapping** for the integration between VTEX stores and Amazon, effective March 31, 2025.

Products already mapped and sent to the marketplace won't be affected; the change will only impact new products.

## What has changed?

Aiming to minimize errors when adding and sending products to Amazon, VTEX is developing **Amazon Listing,** a new module dedicated to managing product integration. 

## What are the next steps?

The **Amazon Listing** module will be available on all VTEX accounts as of March 17, 2025. We suggest using the trial period to get used to the new format and adapt your operation.

If you have any questions or need support using **Amazon Listing,** please contact our [Support team](https://help.vtex.com/support).
