In ecommerce, written content is more than words. It’s a crucial part of the customer experience. From product descriptions and help articles to interface labels, well-crafted product content helps merchants connect with customers, build trust, and drive sales. For everyone in the VTEX ecosystem — including employees, and partners — creating clear, consistent, and user-friendly content is key to unlocking the full potential of VTEX products.

To ensure a seamless experience for everyone, we’re introducing the new [Content Style Guide](https://contentguide.vtex.com/en): A portal designed to guide people while contributing to the VTEX ecosystem with product written content. Whether building apps, writing documentation, or collaborating on projects, this guide is your go-to resource for creating content.
