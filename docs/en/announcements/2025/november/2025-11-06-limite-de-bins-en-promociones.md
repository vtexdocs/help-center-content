VTEX has updated how promotions are limited to only certain types of cards.

This setting is configured using the Card BIN option, located in the Conditions section of a promotion.

## What has changed?
Previously, the promotion forms allowed you to add unlimited bank identification numbers (BINs) in the card restriction settings.

With the new format, the **BIN number** field in the Conditions section now accepts a maximum of 300 BINs per promotion.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required for promotions with up to 300 BINs, as the new limit is automatically applied to promotion forms.  

For promotions that exceed this limit, you must remove the excess BINs before saving the promotion.
