VTEX has just launched a [new Help Center](https://newhelp.vtex.com/en), featuring a lighter interface design, enhanced search, and other updates. The goal is to improve your experience with our documentation by combining high-quality information with a refreshed look and a portal offering more functionality.

## Light and modern look

The new portal features a clean interface focused on readability and easy scanning, with a clear typography, well-structured sections, and a design that prioritizes the information search experience.

By using the VTEX design system, the same used in the [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/), we've unified the experience across portals and refined how documentation is presented following VTEX's visual identity.

## New side navigation menu

Navigation has been completely updated, featuring new categories, improved visibility, and an expandable menu. Additionally, you can use the search bar to search within each section.

## Intelligent and quick search

The content search and indexing technology in the new Help Center has been fully upgraded. We’ve implemented a faster, more efficient search to help you easily locate the information you need.

Using the top search bar, results appear as soon as you begin typing. If you choose to view all results, you'll be redirected to a page displaying results by category, such as tutorials, troubleshooting, and others.

Other updates are related to the [Known Issues](https://newhelp.vtex.com/en/known-issues) and [Troubleshooting](https://newhelp.vtex.com/en/troubleshooting) articles, which now have new sorting and filtering options. The following image is an example of the filters available when searching for a known issue:

## Improvements in the mobile version

Responsive design improvements ensure your experience with our documentation isn't limited by the device you use. The new portal offers a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

There are also additional improvements worth noting:

* New button `Copy for AI`
