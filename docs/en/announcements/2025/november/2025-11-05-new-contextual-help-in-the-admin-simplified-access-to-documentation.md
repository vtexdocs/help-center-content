The new contextual help in the Admin makes it easier to find relevant documentation without leaving your workflow.

The interface offers fast, intuitive navigation with instant access to relevant documentation.

## What has changed?

Previously, contextual help was available through the `?` button in the Admin header, which opened the Information Center with links to the Help Center, Developer Portal, Platform Status, VTEX Blog, and Talk to Our Experts. Users had to leave the Admin to search for answers in these external resources.

Now, the Information Center is accessible via the `? Help` button, which is still in the Admin header. By clicking the button, you're redirected to a screen with the following sections:

- **Give Feedback:** A button that takes you to a form where you can share your feedback about the VTEX products available in the Admin.

- **Related Articles:** Displays up to eight top relevant articles for the module you're working on. This makes it easier to find answers to common questions and complete important tasks. If your question isn't among the available articles, a link directs you to the module category in the Help Center.

- **Additional Resources:** Provides useful links that redirect you to the Help Center, Developer Portal, Platform Status, Troubleshooting, VTEX Blog, and Support.
