To provide more secure and controlled authentication, we have updated how [License Manager](/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) validates access to store order configurations. New features are now required for users to access specific pages in the VTEX Admin. 

## What has changed?

We updated which features of License Manager will be used to validate a user's authentication to access specific pages in the VTEX Admin. Now, the `Save Order Configuration` and `Save OrderForm Configuration` resources are required for the user to access the [general order configuration](/en/tutorial/general-configurations-on-the-oms--tutorials_194) and [affiliate management](/en/tutorial/configuring-affiliates--tutorials_187) pages.

## What needs to be done?

To ensure that your users can access the pages mentioned above, you must [create a custom role](/en/tutorial/creating-roles--qGtNQpKSSAduX94l2WZBW#creating-custom-roles) or [edit the existing roles](/en/tracks/accounts-and-permissions--5PxyAgZrtiYlaYZBTlhJ2A/6Ymo5bNMyEYBGsTmbTC3H9#editing-roles) by adding the `Save Order Configuration` and `Save OrderForm Configuration` features to the role.

Once the resources have been added, the user will be able to access the VTEX Admin pages.
