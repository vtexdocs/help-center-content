---

We developed this feature to allow VTEX stores to configure holidays and non-working days in their integration with Mercado Libre. This ensures that the deadlines informed to customers are always correct and aligned with the store's operation.

## Whats has changed?

Now, in addition to configuring these dates in your VTEX account, it is possible to set different days specifically for the VTEX and Mercado Libre integration.  

The main benefits of this functionality are:

- **More accurate shipping deadlines:** the final deadline for the customer will reflect only working days.  
- **Improved performance on Mercado Libre:** avoids shipping delays caused by unaccounted holidays, protecting your reputation on the marketplace.  

By configuring non-working days in the integration, the seller avoids penalties from Mercado Libre or customer dissatisfaction due to delays.

## What needs to be done?

The feature has been available since September 30, 2025, for all VTEX accounts using the Mercado Libre integration. To learn how to use it, access the tutorial [Mercado LibreHolidays](/en/tutorial/mercado-livre-feriados--4dFhFvy6QBPexqSd8u0vIR).
