announcementSynopsisEN: 'Configure holidays in the Mercado Libre integration.'
---

We developed this feature to allow VTEX stores to configure holidays and non-business days in their integration with Mercado Libre, ensuring that deadlines shown to customers are always accurate and aligned with the store's operations.

## Whats has changed?

Now, in addition to configuring these dates in your VTEX account, you can set different days specifically for the VTEX and Mercado Libre integration.

The main benefits of this feature are:
- **More accurate shipping deadlines:** The final deadline shown to customers will reflect only business days.
- **Improved performance on Mercado Libre:** Avoids shipping delays caused by unaccounted holidays, protecting your reputation on the marketplace.

By configuring non-business days in the integration, sellers can avoid penalties from Mercado Libre or customer dissatisfaction due to delays.

## What needs to be done?

The feature has been available for all VTEX accounts using the Mercado Libre integration since September 30, 2025. To learn how to use it, see the tutorial [Mercado Libre Holidays](/en/tutorial/mercado-livre-feriados--4dFhFvy6QBPexqSd8u0vIR).
