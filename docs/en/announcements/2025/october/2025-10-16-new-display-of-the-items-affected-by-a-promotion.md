We updated the way promotion impact notifications are displayed in the VTEX Admin. Starting October 16, 2025, the promotion review step will more clearly and prominently display the number of products affected by each active promotion.

## What has changed?

The promotion review step has been improved to make it clearer which products will be impacted by the promotion before saving. The main improvements include:

- **Displaying the percentage of affected products:** This information now appears at the bottom of the review screen, making it easier to view the promotion scope. The percentage is calculated based on the following parameters: **SKUs, products, brands, categories, collections, sellers**, and **trade policies**. The calculation now considers all promotion settings that affect products, ensuring more accurate and reliable information.

- **Visual alerts for high-impact promotions:** When the promotion affects **80% or more** of active products, a notification is shown to highlight the extent of the action.

- **Message for promotions with no impact:** If no products are affected, a message indicates that the configured criteria don't match any items in the catalog.

- **Promotion summary optimized for quick reading**: The summary now uses a subtler visual style, intended for information only. This contributes to a smoother review and highlights only the points that require attention.

- **Confirmation by holding Save for 3 seconds:** For promotions with a high-impact alert, you must hold the Save button for 3 seconds to complete the action. This behavior adds an extra layer of safety to the confirmation.

## What needs to be done?

No action is needed. The new alert experience is already available for all promotions created in the VTEX Admin as of October 16, 2025.
