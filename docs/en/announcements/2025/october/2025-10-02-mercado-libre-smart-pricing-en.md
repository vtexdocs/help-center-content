We’ve integrated the **Smart Pricing** feature to help sellers make their product prices more competitive on Mercado Libre in an automated way.

## What changed?

Previously, to adjust prices on Mercado Libre, sellers had to monitor competitors and manually update each listing one by one.
Now, sellers can configure adjustment rules so their prices are dynamically updated based on the lowest value found inside or outside Mercado Libre.

The main benefits are:

- Reduce the time spent on manual adjustments.  
- Increase the competitiveness of your listings.  
- Provide control over price changes with customized pricing rules.  

## What needs to be done?

The feature is available for all VTEX accounts using the Mercado Libre integration starting **October 13, 2025.** To learn how to configure and activate it, see the tutorial [Mercado Libre Smart Pricing](/en/tutorial/precificacao-inteligente-mercado-livre--3J8t9EFFaaxmOloOqzU5Hz).
