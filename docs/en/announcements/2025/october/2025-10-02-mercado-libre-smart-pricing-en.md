We integrated the **Smart Pricing** feature to help sellers automatically set more competitive prices on Mercado Libre.

## What changed?

Previously, to adjust prices on Mercado Libre, sellers had to monitor competitors and manually update each listing one by one.

Now, sellers can configure adjustment rules to dynamically update their prices based on the lowest value inside or outside Mercado Libre.

Key benefits include:

- Reduced time spent on manual adjustments.
- Increased competitiveness of your listings.
- Greater control over price changes with customized pricing rules.

## What needs to be done?

The feature is available for all VTEX accounts using the Mercado Libre integration as of **October 13, 2025.** To learn how to configure and activate it, see the tutorial [Mercado Libre Smart Pricing](/en/tutorial/precificacao-inteligente-mercado-livre--3J8t9EFFaaxmOloOqzU5Hz).
