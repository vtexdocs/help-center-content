To provide a unified and accessible documentation experience, we integrated all documentation for Weni by VTEX products and features into the VTEX Help Center.

**Weni by VTEX** offers post-sales support solutions powered by data, artificial intelligence, and agents, with a comprehensive platform to enhance customer experience (CX).

## What has changed
Previously, this documentation was available through the Weni portal. However, this portal is being deprecated, and the 92 articles are now only available in the VTEX Help Center.

Now, there's a Weni By VTEX tutorials category in our portal, including the following subcategories:
- [Agent Builder](/en/subcategory/agent-builder--3TASbcSqDuDZwmgDLc0O5I): Tool for creating and assigning agents for customer communication.
- [Insights](/en/subcategory/insights--13xAeqd2qH34rW2VHBXuWh): Dashboard with metrics and information about ongoing support tickets.
- [Chats](/en/subcategory/chats--6Jkw23mYV23p4V33O1Hjdh): Human support assistant.
- [Studio](/en/subcategory/studio--2kZMtDveyKwicJ6Hs8s2yN): Module for contacts, messages, campaigns, and message triggers.
- [Integrations](/en/subcategory/weni-integrations--7e9LaCixVcvflzgWkxlftd): Integrations with tools such as ChatGPT, Slack, Instagram, among others.
- [Code Action](/en/subcategory/code-action--3q6HjVqNcRNNZttPAV93wi): Tool for webhook configuration.
- [Settings](/en/subcategory/configuracoes-weni--119WfAe6xGl5c0S1hLdHRQ): Module for project and Weni Chats settings.
- [Flows](/en/subcategory/fluxos--hXGU8pFfABVFIg724zWBN): Chatbot feature and creation of action and message flows.
- [Weni Agentic AI](/en/subcategory/weni-agentic-ai--7BtmQ6zk6O7VJ7QumXJEiM): App for creating and assigning agents for customer communication, available in the VTEX App Store.

## What needs to be done
To access Weni documentation, go to [Weni by VTEX](/en/tutorial/--531cHtUCUi3puRXNDmKziw) in the VTEX Help Center instead of the legacy Weni docs portal.
