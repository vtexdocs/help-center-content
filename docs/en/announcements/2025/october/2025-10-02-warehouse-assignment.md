The **warehouse assignment** feature allows sellers to link different warehouses from their VTEX store to specific Mercado Libre warehouses. This improves inventory accuracy and optimizes order logistics.  

With this configuration, each product is listed on the marketplace based on its warehouse of origin, respecting the handling time and shipping capacity of each location.  

## What has changed?

Currently, VTEX already manages a store's inventory when order delivery is the seller's responsibility.  
With this update, sellers can now allocate their inventory to Mercado Libre's warehouses, taking into account their logistical diversity.  

With this update, you can:

- Assign each VTEX warehouse to a specific Mercado Libre warehouse based on its location.  
- Improve logistics efficiency with multiple pickup points for different Mercado Libre shipping models.  
- Configure shipping capacity and handling time per warehouse.  

## What needs to be done?  

This feature is only available to sellers using the new offer model and who have enabled multi-origin stock on Mercado Libre.
