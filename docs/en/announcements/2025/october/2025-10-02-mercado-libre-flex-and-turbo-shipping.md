We created this feature so VTEX clients can enable Envios Flex and Envios Turbo shipping methods for products sold on Mercado Libre.

This feature is available for all eligible VTEX stores, as Mercado Libre defines which accounts can use these logistics models.

## What has changed?

With these new shipping models, eligible sellers can offer same-day or three-hour delivery.

Key benefits include:
- Increased reach and visibility on Mercado Libre.
- Highlighted listings compared to other sellers.  

## What needs to be done?

This feature is available for eligible accounts chosen by Mercado Libre as of October 06, 2025.

To check if your account is eligible, understand how it works, and learn how to enable these shipping modes, see the tutorial [Mercado Libre Envios](/en/tutorial/mercado-livre-envios--4fbF0Glf0R2YUCxYof4aIL).
