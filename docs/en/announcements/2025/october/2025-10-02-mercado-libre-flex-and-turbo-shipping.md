We created this feature so VTEX customers can enable Envios Flex and Envios Turbo shipping methods for products sold on Mercado Libre.  
This feature is available for all VTEX stores, as long as they are eligible. Mercado Libre is responsible for defining which accounts can use these logistics models.  

## What has changed?

With these new shipping models, eligible sellers can offer products that are delivered on the same day or within three hours.

The main benefits are:

- Increased reach and visibility on Mercado Libre.  
- Highlighted listings compared to other sellers.  

## What needs to be done?

This feature is available for eligible accounts chosen by Mercado Libre starting October 06, 2025.  
To check if your account is eligible, understand how it works, and learn how to enable these shipping modes, see the tutorial [Mercado Libre Envios](/en/tutorial/mercado-livre-envios--4fbF0Glf0R2YUCxYof4aIL).
