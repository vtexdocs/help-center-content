**Amazon Listing** is a new VTEX Admin module designed to make the process of listing products to Amazon more agile and efficient. It allows sellers to send new products efficiently and with a low error rate, guaranteeing smooth integration between VTEX and Amazon.

## What has changed?

**Amazon Listing** is the module that replaces adding products via XML feed, spreadsheet mapping, or the mapper. Previously, the mapping process was 100% manual for all products, and it wasn't possible to validate that the listed attributes and specifications were correct before sending them to Amazon, leading to many errors.  

Now, although the process remains manual, listed attributes are validated before being sent to Amazon. It also offers the following advantages compared to the mapper or spreadsheet:  

- **Automatic pre-completion:** Information such as **title, images, description**, and **keywords** already added to the VTEX catalog are automatically used to pre-list SKUs on Amazon.  
- **Custom templates:** Sellers can create specific templates for product categories, speeding up the listing process.  
- **Centralized information:** All product listing categories and attribute details are centralized in a single place.  
- **Status monitoring:** The module allows tracking the status of products sent to Amazon.  

## What needs to be done?

The new module will be available to all [VTEX accounts acting as sellers](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#sendo-seller-vtex) from March 31, 2025. To learn more about the module and list new products, see the [Amazon Listing](/en/docs/tutorials/amazon-listing) tutorial.
