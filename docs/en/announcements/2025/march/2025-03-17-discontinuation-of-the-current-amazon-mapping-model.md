As informed on the announcement [Amazon: The current product mapping model will be discontinued](/en/announcements/2025-02-19-current-amazon-mapping-model-will-be-discontinued), on March 31, 2025, we will discontinue the following methods for integrations between VTEX stores and Amazon: product listing via XML feed, spreadsheet mapping, and Amazon mapper.

From that date forward, the only way to send products from the VTEX catalog that are not yet available on Amazon will be through the new Amazon Listing module.

Note that products already mapped and sent to the marketplace won't be affected; the change will only impact new products.

## What needs to be done?

As of today, March 17, 2025, the **[Amazon Listing](/en/tutorial/amazon-listing--5HIhbnYzJWkl2yM0o72WrL)** module is available in all VTEX accounts. We suggest using the trial period to get used to the new format. Here are some suggestions:

- Explore the interface and get to know the filters, search, and SKU list.  
- Use filters to efficiently organize and locate SKUs.  
- Add new SKUs to understand how to complete the product fields and send them to Amazon.  
- Test the error correction process for SKUs returned by Amazon.  
- Monitor data synchronization and check the status of sent SKUs.  
- Create templates for products that have already been sent.  

If you have any questions or feedback about **Amazon Listing**, contact our [Support team](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support). To learn more about the module, see the [Amazon Listing documentation](/en/tutorial/amazon-listing--5HIhbnYzJWkl2yM0o72WrL).
