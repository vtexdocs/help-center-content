---

VTEX has a new **More for Less** form, which allows you to configure discounts that apply when the buyer adds a certain quantity of the same product to the cart. For example, in the "Buy 2 Get 3" promotion, the customer gets the discount automatically when they reach the required quantity.

> ℹ️ The More for Less promotion is not available for Seller Portal accounts.

## Why did we make this change?
The new form has been developed to simplify promotion setup and ensure greater precision when giving discounts.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required to access the new form. This update will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores. For more information, access [Creating a More for Less promotion](/en/tutorial/leve-mais-por-menos--tutorials_325).
