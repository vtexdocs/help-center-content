__Black Friday__ is coming. Despite its official date (__November 28__), many stores will start their campaigns a lot earlier. To make sure you'll make the most out of one of the main events on the retail calendar, start prepping soon.

As in previous years, we came up with a guide with recommendations and exclusive tips that will help you ensure your store's health and sales. 

The guide is available to all our clients and partners and may be accessed through the homepage of your Admin or directly through the URL
