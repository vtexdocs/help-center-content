---

From September 9, 2025, a new global feature in the VTEX Promotions module will allow you to set budgets for your planned campaigns. This improvement helps merchants control discount spending and gives more security and predictability in benefit management.

The feature allows you to set a budget per promotion, ensuring that applied promotions don't exceed the planned budget limit.

Additionally, merchants will be able to track, in real time, how much of the budget has been used compared to the available balance, helping them make informed decisions during campaigns.

## What has changed?
The feature allows you to set up a discount budget when creating promotions in the VTEX Promotions module. This limits the total amount granted in benefits, ensuring control over promotional spending.

This feature is valid for the following types of benefits:

- **Buy Together:** Applies to the entire promotion.
- **Buy One Get One:** Maximum price.
- **More for Less:** Applies to the entire promotion.
- **Progressive Discount:** Applies to the entire promotion.
- **Regular:** Fixed amount price, percentage price, maximum price, and price table.

> ℹ️ When the budget is reached, the promotion will automatically stop being applied, even if it is still valid.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The new feature will be automatically available in all VTEX accounts from September 9, 2025.
