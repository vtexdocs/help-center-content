Weâ€™ve updated the way [coupon](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criar-cupom-beta--7lMk3MmhNp2IEccyGApxU) usage limit is applied in promotions. After September 12, 2025, the coupon limit setting will be based on total uses in the store, not on the number of products across purchases.

## What has changed?
Previously, defining the usage maximum meant counting the number of products that used the coupon, which allowed customers to buy more than one item of applicable products in one or more purchases.

Now, defining the usage limit determines the total number of times that the coupon can be used in the store.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The new [configuration for limiting coupon usage](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/lista-de-cupons-beta--5z5ya3IonsC2W4B5h4JrsZ) will be automatically applied to all coupons created after September 12, 2025.
