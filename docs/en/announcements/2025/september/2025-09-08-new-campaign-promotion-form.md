---

From September 8, 2025, the VTEX **Promotions** module will feature a new interface for the **Campaign Promotion form**. The interface has been improved to enhance usability and streamline promotion setup, enabling you to create offers targeted to audiences defined in the [Campaign Audiences module](/en/docs/tutorials/creating-a-campaign-audience).

## What has changed?
The Campaign Promotion form interface has been optimized to make it easier to view and complete the configuration fields. The features remain the same as in the previous version:

- **Campaign audience:** Apply benefits only for customers who meet the configured conditions.
- **Benefit configuration:** Define nominal or percentage discounts, free shipping, gifts, or promotional prices.
- **Activation criteria:** use SKUs, products, categories, brands, or collections as triggers to activate the promotion.

> ⚠️ The new form interface requires that at least one campaign be configured.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The new form will be available in all VTEX accounts starting on September 8, 2025.
