To ensure a unified and easy-to-navigate documentation experience, all **Indeva by VTEX** documentation has been migrated to the [VTEX Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/docs/tutorials/indeva-by-vtex-category). 
 
[Indeva by VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/docs/tutorials/indeva-by-vtex-category) is a solution focused on commercial performance management and sales team productivity. The platform centralizes data, goals, and results in a single environment, making it easier to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales associates.

## What has changed?

Previously, Indeva documentation was available on the Indeva portal. This portal has been deprecated, and all content has been migrated to the VTEX Help Center, under the **Indeva by VTEX** category.
 
The content has been reorganized into subcategories that reflect the main flows and modules of the platform, making it easier to navigate and find information.
