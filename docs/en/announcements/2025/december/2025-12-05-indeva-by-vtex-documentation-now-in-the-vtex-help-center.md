To ensure a unified and easy-to-navigate documentation experience, all **Indeva by VTEX** documentation has been migrated to the [VTEX Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/pt/category/indeva-by-vtex--1QIG6GwCJBv1wrR8wiuWYL). 
 
[Indeva by VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/pt/category/indeva-by-vtex--1QIG6GwCJBv1wrR8wiuWYL) is a solution focused on commercial performance management and sales team productivity. The platform centralizes data, goals, and results in a single environment, making it easier to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales associates.

## What has changed?

Previously, Indeva documentation was available on the Indeva portal. This portal has been deprecated, and all content has been migrated to the VTEX Help Center, under the **Indeva by VTEX** category.
 
The content has been reorganized into subcategories that reflect the main flows and modules of the platform, making it easier to navigate and find information. 
 
In the VTEX Help Center, you'll find the following subcategories:
