Starting on 22/08/2025, merchants will have access to an updated experience of the Regular Promotion form, which allows you to configure promotional campaigns.

With the improved form, you can configure multiple conditions and apply benefits such as:

- Discounts (nominal or percentage)
- Free shipping
- Gifts
- Reward amounts
- Promotional price per table

## Why did we make this change?
The form update aims to make creating and managing promotions more intuitive, giving users greater control over:

- **Eligibility rules:** Including products, brands, collections, categories, and SKUs.
- **Application criteria:** Including order amount, delivery location, shipping method, UTM, among others.
- **Promotion usage rules:** Including limits per customer or store.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The new form will be available in all VTEX accounts starting on 22/08/2025.
