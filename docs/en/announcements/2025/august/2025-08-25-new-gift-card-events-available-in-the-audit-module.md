[Audit](/en/tutorial/audit--5RXf9WJ5YLFBcS8q8KcxTA) is a module that records events that happen in your VTEX store, enabling future auditing. VTEX has improved Audit by adding three new events related to gift card operations.

## What has changed?

Weâ€™ve added the following gift card events to the **Catalog (API)** and **Gift Card** applications:

### Catalog (API)
| Action | Description | Event details |
|---|---|---|
| GiftCard Create | Creates a [native gift card](/en/tutorial/gift-card--tutorials_995) (GiftCard System). | ID of the gift card created and the user who performed the action. |
| GiftCard List All Paged | Internal flow for displaying available gift cards. | ID of the gift cards returned by the API and the user who searched. |

### Gift card
| Action | Description | Event details |
|---|---|---|
| LIST_CARDS_FROM_API | View the [list](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/giftcard-api#post-/giftcards/_search) of native gift cards (GiftCard System). | ID of the gift cards available for a shopping cart. |

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The [Audit](/en/tutorial/audit--5RXf9WJ5YLFBcS8q8KcxTA) update is already active for all accounts.
