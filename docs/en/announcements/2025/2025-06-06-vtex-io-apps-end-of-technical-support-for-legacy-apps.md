---

As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance platform performance, weâ€™re officially ending support for specific legacy and third-party apps. These apps will no longer receive updates, security patches, or technical support from VTEX.

This decision allows VTEX to focus on developing and enhancing other solutions that align with our future strategy and meet growing market demands.

## What does this mean?

Stores that use deprecated apps can continue using them at their own risk, keeping in mind that:

- VTEX no longer provides technical support for these apps.
- VTEX is not liable for issues arising from their use.
- VTEX will not provide bug fixes, updates, or security patches.
- VTEX will not develop new features.
- The documentation will not be updated.

## What needs to be done?

Contact your development team and ask them to follow the instructions in [VTEX IO Apps: End of official support for legacy apps](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes/2025-06-06-vtex-io-apps-end-of-support-for-legacy-apps).
