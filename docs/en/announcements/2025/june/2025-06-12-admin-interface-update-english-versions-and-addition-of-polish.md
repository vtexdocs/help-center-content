## What has changed?

The Admin interface now offers additional language options. In addition to the English options — “English” for international English and “English (US)” specifically adapted for the United States — we’ve added Polish (“Polski”) to the platform.

## Why did we make this change?

This change aligns language identification with global conventions, making the interface more intuitive for users. The inclusion of Polish reflects our commitment to expanding accessibility and meeting the needs of a more diverse user base. The updated names and addition of a new language simplify language selection, especially for international users, and promote a custom experience, adapted to regional preferences.

## What needs to be done?

For Admin users:

- **Review the language setting**: Make sure you know which language is selected in your Admin interface and whether it meets your needs.
- **Explore Polish:** If your operation includes users in Poland, consider setting the language to “Polski” and evaluating the experience.
- **Communicate the change to the team**: Inform your team of the update to ensure everyone knows about the new language options.
