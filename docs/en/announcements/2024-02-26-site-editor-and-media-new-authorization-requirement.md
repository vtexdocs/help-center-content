---

As of Monday, March 18th, 2024, all [users](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-user-tokens) and [application keys](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-application-keys) that need access to [Site Editor](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/site-editor-overview--299Dbeb9mFczUTyNQ9xPe1) and [Media](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/media-overview--31fhjHTt4TBoo50AmGQ9b2) will be required to have the `CMS GraphQL API` License Manager [resource](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) added to their [user roles](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) for content management. 

## What has changed?

As [previously announced for Headless CMS users](https://help.vtex.com/announcements/headless-cms-new-authorization-requirement--7G056zzZmGFBztkRqhpUgj), users and application keys must have the `CMS GraphQL API` resource associated with their role to manage content.  

Now, we are extending this requirement to Site Editor and Media, which means the `CMS GraphQL API` resource is necessary to manage content using these tools.

## Why did we make this change?
This change aims to enhance security and simplify user access to the Site Editor and Media. This means users have a more controlled and secure environment when managing store content. 

## What needs to be done?
Ensure that users are associated with the `CMS GraphQL API` resource within their user roles by either [creating a new role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc?&utm_source=autocomplete#creating-a-role) or editing an existing one.

>⚠️ To manage users and their roles, you need the `Save access profile` resource from the <bold>License Manager</bold> product associated with your user role. For example, the <a href=”https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy#user-administrator-restricted”> User Administrator - RESTRICTED</a> is a predefined role that has the `Save access profile` resource associated with it.
