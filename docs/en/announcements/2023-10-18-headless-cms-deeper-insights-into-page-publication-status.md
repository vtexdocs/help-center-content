announcementSynopsisEN: 'Publishing status on Headless CMS Pages will be discontinued in favor of Build Status for detailed deployment tracking.'
---

Starting November 1st, 2023, the **Publishing** status on Pages in the Headless CMS will be discontinued. Instead, you can track the deployment status of pages through the **Build Status** tool, as [previously announced](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/headless-cms-stay-informed-on-your-publication-progress--3ajb4FgE6nmqjblpSEg3SP). This tool offers a more detailed view of the deployment process of your pages.

When a new page is created, it is initially set to **Draft**, indicating that the page has not yet been deployed. Once the page is successfully deployed, its status is updated to **Published**, meaning that the build process is ready to commence. Upon completion of the build, the page becomes accessible to end users.

![Build Status - EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2023-10-18-headless-cms-deeper-insights-into-page-publication-status_1.gif)

## What has changed?

The **Publishing** status was previously used to describe the deployment process of a CMS page to FastStore. However, it did not provide further details on the process.

Now, by integrating the Build Status tool with other systems like [Releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-releases-page-beta--2p7IiVD6K8i1iRiwHph5sw), WebOps, and [FastStore](https://www.faststore.dev/), the Headless CMS provides more comprehensive insights into the status of these systems.

## Why are we making this change?
The introduction of the Build Status tool aims to improve clarity and transparency in the deployment workflow.

## What needs to be done?
This feature will be implemented into the Headless CMS by November 1st, 2023, and no action is required on your side.
