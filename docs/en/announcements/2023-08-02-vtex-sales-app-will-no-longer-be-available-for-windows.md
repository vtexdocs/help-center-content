As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the user experience, we are deprecating VTEX Sales App for Windows.

## What has changed?

As of October 31, 2023, VTEX Sales App will no longer be available for Windows.

## What needs to be done?

The update will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores using VTEX Sales App. To access it from Windows, or any operating system, you will need to access the web version of VTEX Sales App through the following URL:

```

```
