VTEX is launching a new interface on its payment and anti-fraud provider page in the VTEX Admin, which offers a more intuitive and efficient experience for your operation.

## What has changed?

From now on, you can view the information of providers in your store more quickly. The new layout allows filtering payment and anti-fraud providers by name, type, and operation environment (test or production).

The screen for adding a new provider, editing settings, and searching for providers was also improved for better navigation.

## What needs to be done?

The new payment and anti-fraud provider management page is now automatically available for all VTEX accounts. To leverage the new experience in the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__.

>⚠️ The previous version of the affiliations management interface, available at **Store Settings > Payment > Settings > Gateway Affiliations**, will still be accessible until January 14, 2024.
