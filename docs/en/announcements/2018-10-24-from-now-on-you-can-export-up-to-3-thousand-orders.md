As of __October 24__, the orders management module will only allow you to export up to 3.000 orders. This limit will guarantee the platform's performance, without quality loss of the generated reports.

## What has changed
To ensure the best experience possible, we've been recommending the 3.000 orders limit since June 2018 (as seen on the warning published on the [Exporting orders in OMS] article(/en/tutorial/exporting-orders-with-oms)). The only difference now is that the __button will only be available if the limit is fully respected__.

## How to export more than 3.000 orders
You can still export more than 3.000 orders. To do so, you must use our orders management (formerly known as OMS) APIs: [Get Order](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/orders#getorder) and [Get Feed Order Status](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/feed-v3#getfeedorderstatus1).

>⚠️ **But remember:** For it to work, it's necessary to **create a date/hour range that includes up to 3.000 orders**. After defining a range that respects this limit, you'll be able to make as many requests to the API as you want.
