Many employees access the Admin environment from each account. Therefore, it is essential to limit access to critical actions to ensure that users can only access what is necessary for their role.

In this context, the roles feature is used to assign a set of [resources](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/recursos-do-license-manager--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to admin users, granting them the necessary permissions for store activities.

We have redesigned the **Roles** page to optimize the management of user permissions. To view this page, at the top bar of the VTEX Admin, click your profile avatar — indicated by the first letter of your email — and then click **Account settings** > **User roles**.

## What has changed?

Besides all features from the previous version, the new **Roles** page allows you to:

*	Access the complete list of roles added to your store with a more intuitive and elegant design, updated for the [New VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/admin-vtex-start-here--531cHtUCUi3puRXNDmKziw).
*	View useful information for managing roles directly in the list, such as the number of users associated with each profile, the type of profile (predefined or customized), and the date the profile was created.

## What needs to be done?

This update will be automatically applied to all stores. Learn more on how to use the enhanced page in the [Roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) article.
