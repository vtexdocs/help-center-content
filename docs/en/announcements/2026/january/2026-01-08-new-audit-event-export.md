You can now export events from the searches performed in [Audit](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tutorials/audit). This update makes it easier to share audit information with third parties, such as security teams and regulatory agencies, eliminating the need to open support tickets to fetch this data.

## What has changed?

Previously, audit events could only be accessed within the VTEX Admin, and any export request required contacting Support. With the new feature, Audit now allows exporting the returned events in a file sent by email.

## Why did we make this change?

This new Audit feature was developed to:

- Reduce dependency on technical support and eliminate wait times associated with SLA.
- Facilitate external audits and compliance processes by providing a simple and secure way to share information.

## What needs to be done?

The feature is available to all VTEX accounts. For more information on how to export Audit events, see the Results section of the [Audit](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tutorials/audit) article.
