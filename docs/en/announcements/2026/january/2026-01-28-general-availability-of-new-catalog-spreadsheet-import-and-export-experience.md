announcementSynopsisEN: 'The redesigned interface offers export using filters and status tracking.'
---

By the end of February 2026, all VTEX stores will have access to the new spreadsheet import and export experience for products and SKUs, specifications, and images. Account migration is being done gradually and will be applied to stores in all regions.

The update includes a redesign of the spreadsheet management interface and centralizes the import and export operations in **Catalog > Products and SKUs**.

## What has changed?

The main improvements of the new experience are:

* **Export based on filters and search:** Merchants can use the filters and search on the **Products and SKUs** page to export the items they want. When filters are active, only the results on the list page are exported.
* **Export status window:** Merchants can check whether the spreadsheet export has been completed and the file type that is being processed. This is useful because you can do different types of exports at the same time.

* **New product and SKU import template:** On the list page, when you click **Import > Products and SKUs**, you can find a link to download the import spreadsheet `template` in `.xlsx` format. The fields in the spreadsheet are available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required from merchants. By the end of February 2026, VTEX stores in all regions will be migrated to the new experience.
