[Roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) allow stores to grant users access only to a selection of resources on our platform. While this was enough to protect your account's data integrity and security, users could still see the sidebar menu items for restricted sections of the admin. These sections are no longer visible, so that users will only be able to see the items they are allowed to access. 

>ℹ️ This action has a low impact on store’s operations, since it involves a reorganization of the left navigation, and not changes in individual user roles.  Also, no predefined settings will be lost: if your users already had pre-defined roles and permissions, they will remain the same.

## What has changed?

Before, users could see all sidebar menu items in the admin, including sections they did not have permissions to access. For example, a user with the [call center operator role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#call-center-operator) does not have access to Master Data, but that option would still be visible in their sidebar menu.

Now, users will only see the sidebar menu items they are allowed to access, according to their roles. In our previous example,the user with the Call center operator role would no longer be able to see Master Data in their sidebar menu. 

The image below illustrates how the sidebar might change as a result of these housekeeping procedures to improve your store's security and user experience.

## Why did we make this change?

The goal of this housekeeping procedure is to limit visualization of critical modules within an account, protecting your store’s integrity. In this way, the possibility of disruptions in a store’s operation is minimized and you ensure that each user will only view what they should.

## What needs to be done?

No action is needed! All users should automatically see only the sidebar menu items they are allowed to access.

If a user in your account can no longer see a sidebar menu item they should be able to see, double check their permissions.
