## What has changed?

The user management dashboard design has been refreshed with the same interface standards used in other Admin dashboards, and new features have been added:

- The MFA (multi-factor authentication) configuration is now displayed for each user in the user list.
- A button to export the user list data to a csv file that includes id, email and name.

In addition, the dashboard has undergone some changes:

- User names can now only be edited by users themselves through User Settings. See the [Configuring personal data on the user's screen](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/setting-up-personal-data-on-the-users-screen--3S32bI9Qb6Ecec66SckYK6) article.

- By default, deleting users revoke all their access to the store without deleting them from the database. The delete confirmation message now displays this information, making it more evident.

You can find the complete documentation on the user management dashboard in the [How to manage users](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-users--tutorials_512) article.
