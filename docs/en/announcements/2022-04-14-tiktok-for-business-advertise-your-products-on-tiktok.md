Important practices for a good unified commerce strategy are broadening your sales channels and displaying ads where your buyers are. To achieve that, it is essential to harness the potential of social networks.

For this reason, VTEX has launched an integration with [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/pt-BR/) â€” a social network for creating and sharing short videos.

Now, retailers can use a new sales channel and advertise products seamlessly with TikTok's marketing tools, such as [TikTok Ads Manager](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10178). Currently, the integration is only available for stores in Brazil.

To simplify the setup, we developed the [TikTok for Business](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexbr-tiktok-tbp/p) app, available for free on the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/).

## What are the app capabilities?

With the new TikTok for Business app for VTEX stores, you can:

* Link your TikTok for Business and TikTok Ads Manager accounts.
* Synchronize your product catalog with TikTok.
* Install the [TikTok Pixel](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9663) in your VTEX store.
* Manage your TikTok ads from the VTEX Admin.

For more details on the available features, check out the [TikTok integration guide](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/tiktok-integration--1r0yJSO11nrer1YVu3WTFd).

## What are the advantages of using the app?

We developed the app to allow you to share your products on TikTok and manage TikTok ads centrally from the VTEX Admin.

Our goal is to allow you to create campaigns in TikTok Ads Manager with your VTEX store catalog seamlessly. With the integration, you will be able to use a new sales channel to implement your unified commerce strategy.

##  How to start using it?

The app is fully compatible with [VTEX IO](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2) stores and partially compatible with [Legacy](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj) or [Headless CMS](https://faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0#vtex-headless-cms) stores.

To install the app and integrate your VTEX store with TikTok, follow the instructions in the [TikTok integration guide](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/tiktok-integration--1r0yJSO11nrer1YVu3WTFd).
