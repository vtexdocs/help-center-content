As of __February 28__, we will discontinue the use of Web Service for integrations with VTEX, __except for the Catalog methods__.

>⚠️ Web Service will continue to work for the Catalog, while we work on the development of this service's REST APIs. We will let you know as soon as a migration schedule is defined.

If your store still uses any of these methods, replace them with API integrations. Otherwise, as of February 28, these integrations will no longer work.

VTEX has APIs that address all scenarios currently covered by Web Service methods, which is an old technology, for which there is less and less support.

Below is a list of the Web Service methods that will be discontinued:

- `AddressByAddressClient`
- `AddressGetByClientIdV2`
- `AddressInsertUpdateV3`
- `ClientGet`
- `ClientGetAllFromCreatedDateAndId`
- `ClientGetByCPF`
- `ClientGetByEmailV3`
- `ClientGetByGuidV3`
- `ClientGetV3`
- `ClientInsertUpdateV3`
- `FreightCalculateV3`
- `FreightGetAll`
- `NewsletterGetAllByDate`
- `OrderChangeStatus`
- `OrderChangeTrackingNumber`
- `OrderChangeTrackingNumberV3`
- `OrderGet`
- `OrderGetByClientCpf`
- `OrderGetByStatus`
- `OrderGetByStatusByQuantity`
- `OrderGetNext50FromIdV3`
- `OrderGetV3`
- `OrderPaymentGetAll`
- `OrderStatusGetAll`
- `UpdateNotifyShipping`
- `WareHouseIStockableGetByStockKeepingUnit`
- `WareHouseIStockableGetByStockKeepingUnitV3`
- `WareHouseIStockableUpdate`
- `WareHouseIStockableUpdateV3`
- `ZipCodeGet`
