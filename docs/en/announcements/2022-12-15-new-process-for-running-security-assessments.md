VTEX carefully evaluates the platform resources by testing and identifying vulnerabilities through scans and penetration tests. These vulnerability checks are run periodically, according to scope criticality.

It is also common for retailers to want to run this kind of assessment on their VTEX stores. To this end, VTEX has now developed a detailed process.

## What needs to be done?

To run security tests on your store, you must submit a detailed request and then report to VTEX any vulnerabilities found.
