The *Inventory and Shipping* module allows you to export a spreadsheet containing the items in your warehouse. If your store has more than one warehouse registered, it is possible to export a spreadsheet with all your warehouses at the same time. The spreadsheet file is then sent to your email.

## What changed?

Now, if your inventory is too big, this file will be split into more than one spreadsheet. You will still receive by email the corresponding links to each spreadsheet.


## Why did we make this change?
To stores with many items registered in their stock, the exporting of the spreadsheet was too heavy for your computer to process, and to include all information in only one file. Frequently, the process also consumed a lot of your computer's memmory, and was thus interrupted. 
Now, the files containing too many items will be broken into more than one spreadsheet and sent through a single email to you. This change facilitates the warehouse exportation, bringing improvements to the process.

## Will this affect my store?
This change will only impact stores with inventories that are too big. For the rest of the stores nothing will change, your warehouse spreadsheet exportation will still be done in a single file.
