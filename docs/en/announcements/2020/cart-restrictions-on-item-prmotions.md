Configuration that allows you to customize the items in the cart that are eligible for a promotion. 

We added news ways of determining how many items will benefit from percentage promotion discounts, allowing you to create more complex promotion scenarios. This configuration is now available. 

## What changed?

In addition to determining the total number of eligible items in the cart, you can set specific product and SKU restrictions. 

## What needs to be done?

After configuring the percentage discount type in a Regular Promotion, check the Restrictions section to access the new functionality. For more details on each scenario type, access [our article on promotions for specific scenarios](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/promocoes--6asfF1vFYiZgTQtOzwJchR/jOu9b69mKbrTDfSJYAawy#restricting-promotional-products-in-cart).
