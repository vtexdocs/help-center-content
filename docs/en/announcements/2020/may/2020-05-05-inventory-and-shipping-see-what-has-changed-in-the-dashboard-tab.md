All of your store’s logistics management takes place in the Inventory & Shipping module. It includes the "Dashboard" tab, in which you can configure the carriers, loading docks and inventories that are linked to your operation. We have updated this functionality in order to improve your experience when browsing the Inventory & Shipping module.

## What has changed?

Starting from the 12th of May, 2020, we improved the design of the "Dashboard" tab in the Inventory & Shipping module. In addition to improving interface usability, we changed the tab name to "Shipping strategy". Another change: "Carrier" is now called "Shipping policy" in the VTEX Admin.  


## Why did we change it?
We are evolving VTEX Admin’s Inventory & Shipping module, which includes a series of gradual changes in design and architecture. The old "Dashboard" tab has been remodeled; it is now called "Shipping Strategy" and has better usability.

In addition to the new design, one of the most significant changes was the replacement of the term "carrier" by "shipping policy". This was in preparation for future developments in our logistics solutions. We are constantly evolving our platform to be in line with market needs. In this sense, the change aims to bring the terminology used in our solution closer to market definitions, seeking to maintain concept coherence and facilitating its understanding for users.  

Now you can:
- Search for specific shipping policies through the search bar.  
- Navigate through a more user-friendly interface.  
- Enter information for logistics configuration more intuitively.  

## What has changed in my store?
While the tab design has been improved, the configuration fields have not changed. All information about your store's logistics contained in the Dashboard tab remains the same. You don’t need to do any configuration from scratch or adaptation.

Our Help Center articles will be updated gradually, and a reminder of the change will be displayed for a while to smooth the transition. However, from now on, in your Admin you will find only the term "shipping policies".
