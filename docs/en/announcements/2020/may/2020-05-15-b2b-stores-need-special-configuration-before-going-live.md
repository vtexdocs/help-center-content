__To our clients or partners launching B2B stores:__ B2B stores, similarly to stores coming from VTEX Integrated Store or those migrating to VTEX IO, now need to be specially configured by the VTEX team.


## Which stores are affected?

B2B stores. That is, every store that has a restricted commercial policy (conditional rule), mainly new stores. Click [here](/en/tutorial/setting-up-b2b-on-vtex--tutorials_238) to learn more about B2B stores.

 
## How to proceed

Every B2B store preparing to go into production and make a final domain configuration must contact our support in advance and request the internal configuration.
