To help draw up a more efficient search strategy, you can now have a better overview of these results. You simply need to export the information given by the VTEX Intelligent Search Reports.  

To export, you need to choose specific time frames and select a time frame during the last six months for the report. 

The exported report shows information about search terms during the selected period. This data helps you to manage your business intelligence better.
