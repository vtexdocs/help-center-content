As of February 21th, 2020, VTEX will introduce a new feature for customers with operations in several countries: the promotions filter by country.

This functionality allows customers to configure the promotion’s use to countries that receive deliveries from their store.

Once the functionality is set up, the locations will be displayed in your store’s Admin Promotions module.

For more details about Promotions, see our [track](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/promocoes--6asfF1vFYiZgTQtOzwJchR/2a2D0K85Ahvs4hLnL3Ag7N).
