announcementSynopsisEN: 'New feature allows retailers to configure the maximum automatic payment capture time frame'
---

From October 2020, it will be possible to change the maximum time frame for automatic payment capture to be triggered.

This feature allows clients to define a maximum number of days for payment capture. It is currently available for Braspag, Sitef, and CieloV3 affiliations.

## What has changed

On VTEX, three types of payment capture can take place during the transaction flow: capture after payment confirmation, anticipated capture authorization, and automatic capture, which works as a protection measure.

If the first two capture attempts do not work, automatic capture will ensure that the payment authorization will be processed by the system.

Clients can now define the exact time frame for the automatic capture to happen during the transaction flow, which allows them to offer scheduling services to deliver orders.

## Configuration

The maximum capture time frame must be configured when adding an affiliation.

In the Admin, retailers must fill out the form to configure the automatic capture feature. It has two new fields: "Payment with anticipated capture authorization" and "Change maximum time for automatic payment capture".

For more details, check out the [tutorial on how to fill in these fields and enable automatic capture](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-tempo-maximo-para-captura-automatica--7dwcaxrcgcFJUk7umqPBw2 "tutorial on how to fill in these fields and enable automatic capture").
