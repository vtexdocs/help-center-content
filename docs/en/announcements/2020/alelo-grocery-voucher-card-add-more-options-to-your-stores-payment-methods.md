announcementSynopsisEN: 'VTEX launches its first grocery voucher card payment method.'
---

Starting in July 2020, VTEX will work with Alelo, its first grocery voucher card payment method option.

This is excellent news for clients from the grocery industry as it adds to their accepted payment methods and serves a customer market segment that frequently uses grocery voucher cards.

At present, the grocery voucher card is only valid in Brazil and is only supported as a payment method by the payment acquirer Cielo. 

## What changes
The grocery voucher card is a payment method that has the same behavior as a debit card. This makes its configuration in VTEX admin similar to that of debit cards.

As Cielo is the only acquirer to support Alelo as a payment method, you first need to configure Cielo as a gateway affiliation for your store. You’ll then be able to set Alelo as a payment method.

## Integration

Alelo is also available as part of our Payment Provider protocol, which allows this grocery voucher card to be implemented by any partner that accepts it as a payment method.

To integrate it with your store, simply contact our Partner team.
