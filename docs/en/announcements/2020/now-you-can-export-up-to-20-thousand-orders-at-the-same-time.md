We constantly receive requests and feedbacks about the need to export more orders than allowed today. Therefore, our export limit for orders per report will now be __20 thousand__. Previously, this limit was 7 thousand orders per report.

We are working to raise that limit even further. Soon, it will be possible to export up to 50 thousand orders at a time. The change is being implemented in phases to ensure product safety and stability.

To understand more deeply how orders export work in your VTEX store, read the article [Exporting orders in Orders managment](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/exportando-pedidos-no-gerenciamento-de-pedidos--tutorials_6417).
