The product integration flow on the Via Varejo Marketplace was [modified in their API V4](https://desenvolvedores.viavarejo.com.br/api-portal/content/integracao) to enhance the quality of the information in advertised products. In order to adapt to this evolution, we have included an additional step to the Via Varejo Integration - [mapping categories, variations and attributes](/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-da-via-varejo--3E9XylGaJ2wqwISGyw4GuY/5QVZFYNfuRIQKdq34MbTxz#fazendo-o-upload).

## What changed?

There was no need for mapping to activate the Via Varejo Integration before this change. Mapping categories, variations and attributes for your products is henceforth __mandatory__.

> ⚠️ **Attention:** Products created or updated after this change will only be integrated if their category, variations and attributes are mapped out.

## Why did we make this change?

To ensure the best positioning and experience for our clients in the certified marketplaces, we need to follow the evolution of their integration interfaces. Although this change was not yet required, we evaluated its benefits as meaningful. 

## Main benefits
- Decrease in marketplace cataloguing time
- Greater control over your products' categorization
- SEO and UX improvements resulting from Via Varejo evolution

## What do you need to do?

Map categories, variations and attributes according to our [documentation](/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-da-via-varejo--3E9XylGaJ2wqwISGyw4GuY/5QVZFYNfuRIQKdq34MbTxz#fazendo-o-upload).

> ℹ️ This process can be performed gradually according to your needs and only needs to be done once per category. Once a category and its variations/attributes are mapped, all products in that category will be integrated normally without requiring any additional action.
