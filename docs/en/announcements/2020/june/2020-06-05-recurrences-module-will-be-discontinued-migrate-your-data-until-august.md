> ℹ️ The discontinuation will only affect stores that still have the Recurrences module. For stores that are already using the Subscriptions module or that don’t have this functionality, nothing will change.

The *Recurrences* module is an earlier version of our current *Subscriptions* module. This version will be discontinued, and all stores that still use it must migrate to the *Subscriptions* module by **August 3rd, 2020**.

Follow the step by step below to migrate your data easily and smoothly.

## Why will we deactivate the Recurrences module?

Our current Subscriptions module is an advanced solution for recurring orders. It has more features than the Recurrences module, and is constantly evolving. We want to encourage stores to use our complete Subscription solution, taking full advantage of its features to expand their businesses.

To learn how the Subscriptions module works, click [here](/en/tutorial/how-subscription-works--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453).

## Why migrate to the Subscriptions module

- **More control**: The Subscriptions module provides a reliable scheduler, with several control mechanisms to ensure that your store’s subscriptions are executed on the scheduled date.
- **Better experience for the end customer**: We provide a new interface in My Account for subscribers to clearly know which products they subscribed to and to be able to perform actions directly on their subscriptions, without the need to contact the store.
- **Visibility**: The Subscriptions module has a new and refurbished administrative dashboard, where you can monitor the health of your subscriptions, and act as quickly as possible when subscribers change personal data (such as addresses and credit card information) that need intervention to avoid losing the sale.
- **Intelligence with data**: We provide several reports for you to extract the data from the subscriptions made and those to come, which provides a complete view of how subscriptions are contributing to your business.
- **More personalization**: We improved the settings tab to help you customize your store’s subscriptions according to your business reality.

## What is the impact on my store?

The Recurrence module in your Admin will be deactivated. This means that it won’t receive any maintenance starting from August 3, 2020, and will no longer be evolved. Besides, from that date onwards, **it won’t be possible to make any data requests about active operations, nor receive support from VTEX, in case of problems and errors in the module**.

Thus, the migration from the Recurrence module, to Subscriptions module should be done by all VTEX clients that still use this functionality.

## What should I do?

To avoid losing this data, you must **migrate the information from the Recurrences module to Subscriptions before August 03**. Check out the complete walkthrough for migration [here] (https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-migrate-from-recurrence-v1-to-subscriptions-v2--3nJ4pbsRHEyKmvoN0foYRi). VTEX will offer assistance to make the migration as smooth as possible.
