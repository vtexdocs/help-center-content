Retail operations working in the B2B (Business to Business) model count on a series of settings that deviate from the standard model of interaction between the store and the end consumer.

In B2B, shopping carts are often larger, with higher values and more complex tax systems; payment conditions require some particular approaches, such as intelligent credit management; promotions need the flexibility to address peculiar cases; assisted selling requires less rigid checkout handling; among several other particularities.

VTEX is a platform increasingly prepared to meet scenarios like these. And, to help our stores to navigate more easily through the configurations that meet these scenarios, we prepared a series of articles with documentation focused on the B2B model.
