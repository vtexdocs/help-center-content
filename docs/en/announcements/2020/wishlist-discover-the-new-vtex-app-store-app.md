You requested it, and we got it: your store can now make the wishlist functionality available to end customers! Boost customer engagement and increase your sales by allowing customers to create desired products collections for future purchase.  

The application is available in the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/ "VTEX App Store") and can be downloaded for free by all stores running on VTEX IO. 

## What are the capabilities?

- Adding a heart icon next to each product in the product lists and product detail pages;
- Creating a Wishlist page, where customers can see their favorite items and easily purchase them.
