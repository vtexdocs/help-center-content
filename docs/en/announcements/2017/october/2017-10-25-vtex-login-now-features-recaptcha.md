VTEX login via e-mail and password now features reCAPTCHA, which makes store access more secure.

We use Invisible reCAPTCHA, a Google technology that determines when it's necessary to confirm whether the access attempt is being made by a robot or a human.

![reCAPTCHA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2017/october/2017-10-25-vtex-login-now-features-recaptcha_1.png)

This means that the confirmation request may or may not appear, depending on several variables.

With this change, VTEX no longer prevents user access after 3 incorrect attempts, since security is guaranteed by reCAPTCHA.

> ℹ️ Currently, we only use reCAPTCHA in the admin login flow.

> ⚠️ Due to this change, [it is no longer possible to use email and password for integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/integrations-with-vtex-apis-now-need-token-authentication--7AdnXDH7AkYmuEUmmis8Es).
