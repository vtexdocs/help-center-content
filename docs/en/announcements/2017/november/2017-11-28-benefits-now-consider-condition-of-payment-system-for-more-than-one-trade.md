Benefits in the Promotions & Taxes module now recognize the payment system filter combined with the trade policy filter.

## How it was before

Previously, benefits with payment system conditions were only applied to the main trade policy. As a result, benefits with payment system filters could not be applied to other trade policies.

## What has changed

In the current scenario, benefits now consider the payment system condition by trade policy. That means that a benefit with payment system filter can be applied to more than one trade policy. With this improvement, the retailer has more flexibility to configure his benefits.
