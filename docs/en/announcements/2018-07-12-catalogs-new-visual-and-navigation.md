On __July 10__, we gave an important step towards the unification of the user experience on VTEX's platform. We've updated the Catalog's look and feel, applying the __New Admin's__ style. But we kept untouched most of the flows and features you already know, so you'll have minimum impacts on your daily routine.

The main difference to the old version is on how you navigate through it. We've rearranged some pages and sections, so they make more sense in the __New Admin__.


## What has changed

Most items of the old Catalog can now be found on the _Catalog_ option, on the sidebar's _PRODUCTS_ section.

The _Gift card_ subitem (formerly known as _Vouchers_ and previously located under the _Campaign Control_ tab) is now one of the _Payments_ drop-down options, on the sidebar's _TRANSACTIONS_ section.

The _Settings_ item (formerly a tab of its own) is now one of the _CMS_ drop-down options, on the sidebar's _STORE SETUP_ section.

The former _Marketplace_ tab continues independent (even the name remains the same), with a section of its own on the sidebar.
