We have enhanced the unified search in VTEX Sales App to improve user experience when browsing and searching for products.

This improvement allows sales associates to find products beyond the store's inventory and add them to the cart. Click the magnifying glass icon <i class="fas fa-search"></i>  and enter the product name, reference code, SKU ID, or EAN in the search bar on the store's homepage.

## What has changed?

- **Intuitive search list:** You'll have access to an intuitive and informative search list, which offers a simplified view of your previous searches.

- **Detailed view of products:** Spaces have been optimized, allowing you to see more items with larger, higher-quality images. Adding products to the cart, especially those with a single SKU, is now more straightforward and simplified.

- **Search refinement with filters:** You can apply filters by clicking the predefined filters, without having to submit the form with the `Apply Filters` button. In addition, applied filters will be displayed at the top of the page, making it easier to know which filters are in use and easily remove any of them.

- **Quick view of unavailable products:** Before, the system displayed all products as unavailable and, after some time, loaded their availability correctly. Now, product availability is immediately displayed when the product loads.

- **Optimization for slow connections:** By leveraging browser caching, the search will return new information only when necessary, guaranteeing a fast response even in scenarios with slow internet connections.

## Why did we make this change?

This change is meant to improve the browsing and product search experience of sales associates. This will make their search journey more intuitive and informative.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The feature will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores using VTEX Sales App. For more information, see the article [Unified search in VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-usando-o-app--4BYzQIwyOHvnmnCYQgLzdr/9sXeVwoD60qYYgRJ11r5F).
