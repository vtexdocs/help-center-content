## What has changed?

When trying to access a store's Admin using an email address, you have the option to receive an email containing an access code for login. The footer of the received email now contains the following information about the device from which the access request originated:

- Web browser
- Operating system
- IP address
- Geolocation data provided by the IP address (city, state and country)

## Why was it implemented?

Security is a major focus here at VTEX, which takes center stage even more as major events like Black Friday comes into play. This new feature can help identify the source of an unauthorized access attempt.
