You don't need to register pickup points one by one anymore. Now, you can use your Admin to upload an XLS file [(like this one)](//assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2QZFVRKdaoOkykE4AUkw6m/bdf62b6d028819b5b8c08ef7a27eadc6/pickups_example.xls) with all the pickup points you want to offer on your website.


## Your logistics setup has never been this fast
With the new upload feature, you can register more than one pickup point at once, right through your store's Admin. The process becomes easier, bringing more agility while setting up your pickup points.

 
## How to upload the spreadsheet
We've designed the feature in the most intuitive way, but you can find details about it on [this VTEX Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-import-pickup-points-using-spreadsheets).
