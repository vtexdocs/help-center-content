With full support to the TLS 1.2, VTEX's Payments service in the `vtexpayments.com.br` domain are now safer than ever. Following the Payments recommendations, we've updated our platform with the protocol's new version and deprecated the support in this API for the versions 1.0 and 1.1 (wich presented serious security breaches). 

This affects only the checkout (because of the payment methods steps) and integrations wich comunicate directly with Payments. Other parts of your store will still be served by the previous versions until you complete it's migration to the new CDN. We recommend you to follow this [VTEX Help article](/en/tutorial/activating-new-vtex-cdn) and activate the new CDN before __April 21st__.
