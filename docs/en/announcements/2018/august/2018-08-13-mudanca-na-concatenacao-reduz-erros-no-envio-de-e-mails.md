From now on, your store can use a semicolon (`;`) to concatenate e-mail addresses in the Message Center. That is, when you need an email to be sent to a series of addresses, you can access the Message Center __Templates__ option and, within the template you want, separate the recipients with a semicolon.

This feature works for both the copy field (`Cc`) and the hidden copy field (`Bcc`), just as the comma already worked. The two concatenation options are now valid.

This simple change in the module responsible for sending transactional emails dramatically reduced the error rate on customer communications.

The chart below shows the error rate of a store before we implemented the support for semicolon concatenation. More than 90% of e-mails failed every day.

After the improvement was implemented, the errors in sending transactional emails from the same store were completely eliminated, as this other chart shows:
