Because many stores couldn't perform the necessary actions to activate the new CDN on time, we've decided to extend the deadline until __May 31st__.

## What is the new CDN?
The CDN is a network that's used to deliver all the content in your website (text, images, videos). The new CDN is better and safer, but your store needs to take action in order to use it. To know more, read the instructions bellow or this [VTEX Help article](/en/tutorial/activating-new-vtex-cdn). 

## Why it is so critical?
__If your store doesn't make the changes, it will go offline.__

## What must be done?
You need to do just 3 things to get your store ready to the change:
- Activate HTTPS in all the pages of your website
- Update to the new CNAME
- Fill this form: [Migration to the new CDN](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdae71lH2ppAgjDw_bJ8E2ZMnL8psm3pEEXbEViQOSsx5eVwQ/viewform)

__If you get those 3 steps done, your store shouldn't have any problems__. To know more, follow the instructions bellow or read this [VTEX Help article](/en/tutorial/activating-new-vtex-cdn). If you're not sure how to make these changes or if your store is Se você não tiver certeza como realizar essas mudanças ou não sabe se sua loja já está adequada, __send this announcement to your support or IT team. It's critical that all those actions are implemented, so your store can keep selling.__

## Complementary information
Besides de deadline, some measures have already been implemented for all stores:
- HTTP is no longer allowed in the checkout pages. All stores now use the HTTPS protocol.
- New folders (or the ones that have been changed) are already using HTTPS.
- Inactive accounts (or the ones that were not in stable) have been updated to HTTPS.

Note that, to complete the activation of the new CDN, it's __absolutely necessary to enable HTTPS throughout your whole website__. Details on how to do that are in [this VTEX Help article](/en/tutorial/enable-https-throughout-the-site).

After enabling HTTPS, you must:
- Update your DNS to VTEX's new CNAME.
- Request activation of the the new CDN.

If your store's domain points to anything that contains `vtexcommerce.com.br` or `hodor.vtex.com`, you're still using the old CNAME. The update is necessary because all content will be hosted in `{hostname}.cdn.vtex.com`.

> ⚠️ After **May 31st**, the old CNAMEs will stop working. **All stores using them will crash**.

After HTTPS is enabled and your store is updated with VTEX's new CNAME, you'll need to request the activation of the new CDN. If you don't do this until __May 31st__, the activation will be done automatically. That's why it's so important to follow the instructions already given and reinforced in this announcement: it's the only way to avoid future problems with your store.
