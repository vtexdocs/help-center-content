As of __12/26/2018__, the Orders Management module will display information about the currency and the country of origin of all orders. The change will make it easier to operate stores which sell products in more than one currency.


## What changes
On the order's screen, it's value will be accompanied by a code representing the currency. For example, `BRL` or `USD`. That way, the __Orders Management Report__ will get a new column: __Currency Code__ will receive the codes which represent the order's currency.


## Main advantages
Stores which sell in more than one country will have a simple and effective way to check for the currency used on a given order. Orders management becomes easier, as the experience of those who already sell (or are thinking of selling) globally gets even better.

Another point is, by enhancing the data consumption on the platform, we build the foundations to make our management tool more and more complete.
