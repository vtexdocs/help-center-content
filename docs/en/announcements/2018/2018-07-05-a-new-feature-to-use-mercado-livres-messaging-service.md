VTEX has developed a new feature so you can use Mercado Livre's messaging service. Now, the data of every order is sent to the marketplace to notify your clients.

## How it works
With this new feature, VTEX sends updates of an order's status to Mercado Livre. This data is used by the messaging service, which in turn sends a report to your customer about their purchase. As the process flows, auto messages are sent when the __order is approved__, the __tracking URL is available__, and the __order has been delivered__.

## Why this is good for you
- Your customers will have a clearer vision of their purchases.
- The order flow will be more transparent, making your store more trustable.
- Messages are fully customizable. All you need to do is edit them on VTEX's platform.
- The tracking URL is sent automatically. One less worry in your daily routine.

Set it up now on your store, installing the [Mercado Livre](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-mercado-libre/p) app from the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/).
