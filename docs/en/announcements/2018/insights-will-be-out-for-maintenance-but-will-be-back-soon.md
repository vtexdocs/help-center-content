Insights, the VTEX module that gives details of your store's performance, will be out for maintenance. Therefore, __as of December 11 of 2018, it will be unavailable for all platform users.__


## Why is this maintenance necessary?
It is needed to make a few corrections on behaviors that affect some features' usability.


## When will Insights return?
Insights will be back right on the first weeks of 2019, with improved usability. That will make it easier to check your store's metrics out and identify opportunities.

Stay tuned for more news about the Insights relaunch.
