The shopping cart (v5 and v6) of your store now can handle up to 300 items. But it won't make the loading speed of the page slower, because of the optimizations we've implemented.


## What got better
- Customers can add up to 300 items without any performance issues.
- We have also increased the capacity for quantities of each item. 
- Cart visualization now shows 50 items per page.
- Carts with more than 50 items are sorted from the most recent to the oldest.


## Why this is a big deal
These updates meet the needs of those stores which sell large quantities of various items (such as B2B businesses and grocery). The 50-item-per-page visualization also ensures the page's performance. That way, the loading speed won't be affected, and the shopping experience will be as frictionless as possible.
