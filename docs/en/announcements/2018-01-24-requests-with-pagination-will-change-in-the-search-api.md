>⚠️ **Warning**: VTEX has two search options - VTEX search and VTEX Intelligent Search. This article refers to the VTEX search. To learn more about the VTEX Intelligent Search application, see <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb">this track</a>.

Starting __march 31st__, the  request header `resources` for pagination will be deprecated. As a result, you will have to use the parameters `_from` and `_to` in the URL in order to make a request. For example:

`http://{{AccountName}}.{{environment}}.com.br/api/catalog_system/pub/products/search?ft=refrigerator&_from=1&_to=30`

This change has already been implemented in the API, but until the due date, both ways to make the request will be permitted. On the other hand, we won't make any changes in the response header `resources` (so it will keep working normally).

>⚠️ **Important:**
>
>  
> - The parameters **_from** and **_to** must not have a difference bigger than **50**. This will limit the number of results shown to 50 at a time.
>
> 
>
>
> 
> - There's also a limit of 2500 items for any given search. Because of that, it's not possible to have a value over 2500 at the **_to** parameter.
