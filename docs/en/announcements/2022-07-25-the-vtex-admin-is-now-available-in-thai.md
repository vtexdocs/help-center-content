The VTEX Admin currently supports different languages. We localize our product to improve the customer experience, not only by translating our platform, but also by taking into account the particularities of each country.

## What has changed?

As of July 2022, VTEX users will find a new language option in the Admin: Thai. This makes our platform available in the following languages:

* Portuguese
* English
* Spanish
* Italian
* Romanian
* Japanese
* Dutch
* French 
* Korean
* Bulgarian
* Thai 

## Why did we make this change?

The localization of the Admin into Thai was driven by the goal of better serving the local market, making us reliable partners for our customers' success in Southeast Asia.  

## What needs to be done?

To view the VTEX Admin in Thai, select **TH** from the language dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen.
