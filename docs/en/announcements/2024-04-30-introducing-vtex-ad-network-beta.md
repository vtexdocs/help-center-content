VTEX is launching [VTEX Ad Network (Beta)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-ad-network-beta--2cgqXcBuJmXN2livQvClur). This product aims to connect advertisers with merchants interested in promoting their products, allowing both to boost their business.

## Advertisers

Advertisers can [create ad campaigns](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/anunciando-com-vtex-ad-network-beta--5WoXcJzHc7EQElpPjziqse) to promote products in stores selling those products. This allows them to boost sales and view data to improve decision-making.

When you create campaigns for your product, your ad can be highlighted in multiple VTEX stores with that product in their catalog.

## Merchants

Merchants can offer ad space in their stores for advertisers to promote products. In return, these merchants will receive a fee for each click on an ad in their stores.

VTEX will select ads for your store, featuring products already in your catalog to ensure a smooth and seamless buying journey. This selection is based on your customer behavior.
