---

Your customer's journey ultimately leads to the decisive **checkout** step, the last leg of the shopping experience. This stage defines whether or not your customer will buy the product in question. Therefore, this experience needs to be as **efficient and enjoyable** as possible. 

In accordance with its innovation, security and simplicity principles, VTEX is launching the **new SmartCheckout**, also called **Checkout v6**. To cater to evermore complex scenarios, as well as to render the order placing experience as **rich and simple** as possible, VTEX is launching new features that will result in higher customer satisfaction and an increase in sales. 

Read more on the main improvements of this new version below:

## Collect orders from Pick-up Points 

With the new SmartCheckout, your customer will be able to choose whether to have an order **delivered** at home or collect it from a **pick-up point**. Your store hereby gains a new e-commerce delivery method and opens a new sales channel for brick-and-mortar stores.

## Split delivery between "Deliver at home" and "Pick-up from store"

In the previous version, the customer was unable to place an order if the chosen products could not be delivered by the same **delivery type** (Express Delivery, Next Day Delivery, Free Delivery, etc). 

With the new version, our checkout can **combine any available delivery type** to place an order, which means that your customer can receive partial delivery at home and pick up the remaining products from a store or other pick-up point.

## More intuitive delivery options choice

The new SmartCheckout also brings your customer more simplicity when **choosing delivery options** for an order.

If the choice is to **receive products at home**, up to three delivery options could be shown at checkout:

- **More economic**
- **Faster**
- **Mixed**

The **More Economic** option considers the cheapest delivery options, looking to appeal to price-driven customers. 

The **Faster** option looks at deliveries with potentially less delivery time, catering to the needs of customers who demand more agile deliveries.

The **Mixed** option chooses the best cost-benefit ratio between price and delivery time, offering customers a more balanced delivery option.

With these suggestions, your customers will be able to clearly and intuitively decide which delivery method best fits their needs.

## Shopping cart shipping simulator

In addition, Checkout v6 has a **shipping simulator** in the shopping cart stage, anticipating delivery scenarios that your customer may encounter during checkout.
