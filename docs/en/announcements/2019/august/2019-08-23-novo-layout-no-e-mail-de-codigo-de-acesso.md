We've updated the layout for the email you receive when requesting an access code for your admin. From now on, every time access to login or change password is requested, you'll receive an email as the one shown below:

![announcement-novo-layout-email-codigo-acesso EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2019/august/2019-08-23-novo-layout-no-e-mail-de-codigo-de-acesso_1.png)

## What changes
The new version makes the layout more seamless and usable, in addition to making it more coherent with VTEX's visual identity.
The code has also been given more highlight in the email's body, making the information stand out. Another novelty is that a version is available for each language.

The new layout is up-to-date with our brand and is part of our ongoing effort to improve and take our product further.
