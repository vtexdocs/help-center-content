announcementSynopsisEN: 'New `Authorized Date` field format ensures an easier and clearer understanding of the date when the order was authorized'
---

Starting June 12<sup>th<sup>, 2019, we will change the format of the `Authorized Date` field, found in the [orders report](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/exportando-pedidos-no-gerenciamento-de-pedidos--tutorials_6417) which is exported from the Order Management module.

## Key Advantages 

The new `Authorized Date` field format ensures an easier and clearer understanding of the date when the order was authorized. In addition, it follows the default of the other already existing report dates, making editing data easier and more intuitive. 

## Necessary steps

If you are using a macro or automation that takes the `Authorized Date` field into consideration, you need to pay attention to the `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` formatting field, where:

- `yyyy` represents the four digits of the year
- `MM` are the two digits of the month
- `dd` are the two digits of the day
- `HH` represents the hour, in 24-hour format
- `mm` are the two digits for minutes
- `ss` are the two digits for seconds
