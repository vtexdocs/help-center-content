We announce discontinuing the use of __Maximum Price per Item__ feature, from the Promotions & Taxes module, starting June 17, 2019. This means that, after this date, new benefits of this type will no longer be able to be created. __The already existing benefits will not be impacted, it will be functioning normally until their expiration dates__. Additionally, bulk uploading for promotions of this type will no longer be available as of this date. 

As workaround, we recommend the use of __Promotional Price Table__ .

## What does this mean?

As of June 17 2019, the feature of creating benefits by maximum price of item will be suspended. When creating a benefit in this scenario, it will be necessary to use the __Promotional Price Table__ filter. 

## Why is VTEX removing this feature? 

VTEX developed a new feature of __Promotional Price Table__, that has the same effect of the discontinued feature, but without SKUs limit in the benefit. Meaning that the retailer will have more liberty when creating benefits with the amount of items desired. 

## How does it impact the store operation?

The benefits of Maximum Price per Item registered previously will continue working. For new benefits the use of  __Promotional Price Table__  will be necessary. 

## What should the retailer do?
