The new error screen in the Admin offers more direct communication, focusing on clear instructions for identifying and fixing issues in the store.

## What has changed?

With a focus on improving the user experience, the new error screen includes the following updates:

- **Simplified visual experience:** The new error screen has been redesigned with a cleaner, more intuitive look, ensuring that instructions are clear and accessible.

- **Hidden technical details:** Technical information has now moved to the browser console, making diagnosis accessible for developers and support teams without exposing complex information to the average user.

- **Automatic reconnection:** The screen now makes automatic reconnection once after 10 seconds without requiring user intervention, which increases the chances of resolving issues quickly.

See the new error screen below:

No action is needed. The new error screen is now automatically available to all Admin users.
