---

In every ecommerce operation, it is necessary to add or edit product information in the store. To make sure that this data is up to date and quickly available to the customer, the products must be indexed.

To improve the catalog indexing monitoring experience, we redesigned the **Indexing History** page in the VTEX Admin. The new interface allows you to track the indexing time of products and the indexing status of your store.

![Histórico da Indexação 1 - EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2022-09-06-new-indexation-history-screen_1.png)

## What has changed?

Previously, VTEX featured two different types of indexing: one for the [Catalog](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ), and one for [Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb). Now, the process is unified in the **Indexing History** page.

The **Indexing History** page has been completely redesigned. Check out the main changes:

*	We introduced more accessible and optimized filters and search options.
*	We added a timer with the average indexing time of the products.
*	We increased the indexing details of each product.
*	We updated the page design to follow the _design system_ of the [New VTEX Admin](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/?utm_source=announcement&utm_medium=help_center&utm_campaign=sku_bindings).

To view the page, log in to your VTEX Admin and go to **Store Settings** > **Search** > **Indexing History**.

## Why did we make this change?

We redesigned the **Indexing History** screen to provide a holistic view of the most relevant information in a transparent and direct way to the user.

## What needs to be done?

The **Indexing Status** page of Intelligent Search will be disabled and replaced by **Indexing History**. No action is required. All stores will be automatically updated. For more information on how to leverage the interface, please refer to the article [Indexing History](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/indexing-history-beta--6v2FVuXVpyEO8hnMqPi6Xd).

This page follows the new VTEX design system, with a cleaner, more modern, and user-friendly look.
