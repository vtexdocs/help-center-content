---

We've improved the global search bar at the top of the VTEX Admin pages. Now, not only you can search the Admin pages but also store orders.

Starting today, October 17, this improvement will be available globally for all VTEX stores through an automatic update.

## What has changed?

Previously, the global search bar allowed you to search only the VTEX Admin pages. Now, you can also search your store orders by using any of the following criteria:

- Order ID
- Customer name
- Customer email
- Customer document

To do this, click the search bar, select the `Orders` option, and search for what you want. Each search can return up to 10 results, as shown in the image below:

By clicking a result, you will be redirected to the [Order Details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-do-pedido--2Y75n54Cc9VizrlG1N6ZNl). The last 10 orders you searched for will be recorded in your recent search history, making access more convenient. The search record is stored at the [user](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciando-usuarios--tutorials_512) level and not shared among users.

>ℹ️ To access orders via the VTEX Admin global search, the user [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) must be associated with the **View Order** resource (OMSViewer key) of the Order Management System (OMS).

## Why did we make this change?

Using the global search bar to access orders makes it easier to manage order-related operations, increasing efficiency.

Now, regardless of the VTEX Admin page you are on, you can access the global search bar and find orders without going to the **Orders** module.

## What needs to be done?

Starting today, October 17, all VTEX stores will be automatically updated with the improvement. No action is required from you.
