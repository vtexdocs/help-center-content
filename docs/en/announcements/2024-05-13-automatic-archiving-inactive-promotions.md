To enhance the promotion management experience, VTEX is introducing an automatic archiving feature for inactive promotions. This feature helps you organize and monitor the promotions available in your store.

## What has changed?

We have implemented the following improvements to the promotion management experience:

**Promotion auto-archiving rules:**

1. **Promotions with an end date (not activated):** These will be automatically archived 7 days after the last change, counting from the promotion end date.

2. **Promotions without an end date (not activated):** These will be automatically archived 30 days after the last change.

3. **Promotions with an end date (active):** These will be automatically archived 7 days after their end date.

**Feature optimization:** We've improved the loading time and performance of the promotions list.

>ℹ️ To view the promotions that have been automatically archived, go to VTEX Admin **Promotions > Promotions**, or type **Promotions** in the search bar at the top of the page. In the top right corner, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i>, and then click Applied Promotions.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The feature to automatically archive inactive promotions is now available in all VTEX stores.
