__Customer Credit__ is VTEX's new solution for your store to offer credit to its best customers. Launched today, it brings several features that didn't exist within Credit Control: More deadline and installments options, authentication and credit available right on your store's checkout, and a pre-authorization and capture system more like the ones used by credit card payments.

Get an overview of everything __Customer Credit__ has to offer on [this VTEX Help article](/en/tutorial/customer-credit-overview).


## What has changed
To offer selected customers credit as a payment method on your store, you have to [install the Customer Credit app](/en/tracks/customer-credit-getting-started). So, as of today, when Customer Credit becomes available at [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/), __the previous Credit Control feature will be discontinued__.


## What's the impact
__Nothing will change on the way your store works.__ Credit limits, invoices, and all other data related to your clients will remain the same. The change will only bring benefits, with new features and more setup possibilities.


## What you need to do
If you already use Credit Control, then you don't need to do anything. The whole migration process will be performed by VTEX.

For stores that still don't offer a credit of their own, follow the [tutorial on how to set up the Customer Credit app](/en/tracks/customer-credit-getting-started).
