It has become easier to edit your personal VTEX Admin access settings.

VTEX ID team has created the My User screen, which can be easily accessed by the Admin topbar.

In this screen you can:
- View your email registered on Admin.
- Edit your phone number.
- Set up 2-factor authentication via SMS.
- Set up 2-factor authentication through app.
- Disable 2-factor authentication.

See in more detail what you can do with the new My User screen in the article [Setting up personal data on the user's screen](/en/tutorial/setting-up-personal-data-on-the-users-screen).
