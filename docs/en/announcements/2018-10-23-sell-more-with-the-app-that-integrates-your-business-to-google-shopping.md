__Black Friday__ is coming. And with it comes the need to use this unique opportunity to sell more and better.

To help you with this task, VTEX is launching an __exclusive app in partnership with Google__, which will be available in our [App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-google-shopping/p).

![Google Shopping App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_1.png)

It integrates your business with Google Ads and allows you to advertise your products on Google Shopping, using the new Smart Shopping Campaigns, and track the results easily and quickly.

To help you learn all about it, and understand how the app can revolutionize your business, we will hold an exclusive event at VTEX office to present it first hand.
