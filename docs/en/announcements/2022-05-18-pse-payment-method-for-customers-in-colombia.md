VTEX now offers one of Colombia's most popular payment methods, [PSE](https://www.pse.com.co/empresa) (Pagos Seguros en LÃ­nea). It redirects customers to their internet banking page once the order is confirmed and the payment is made by online debit.

PSE was developed by ACH Colombia (a Colombian financial entity that controls bank transfers) and operates in partnership with the largest banks and thousands of companies in Colombia.

## What has changed?

PSE is available as a payment method in VTEX stores for transactions in Colombia.

##  What needs to be done?

To enable PSE in your store, perform the steps below:
- Check with your chosen payment provider if it already has PSE integrated into the PPP ([Payment Provider Protocol](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/payment-provider-protocol--RdsT2spdq80MMwwOeEq0m)) connector. If it is not available yet, ask the provider to perform the connector configuration to [set up the connector](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pse-payment-method).
- Open a request in the [VTEX Support Portal](https://help.vtex.com/support) (via ticket) to enable the PSE payment method and inform which payment provider will use this method.
- Install and configure the Banks for PSE application, and set up the PSE in your store. Learn more in the article [Setting up the PSE payment method](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/setting-up-payments-with-pse--7dRChubn7TqdEyWrHQEQp6).
