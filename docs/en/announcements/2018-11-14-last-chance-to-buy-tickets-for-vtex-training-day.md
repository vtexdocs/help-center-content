The event that brings together the brains behind VTEX is just around the corner, and we're running out of tickets. But you can still get the chance to attend it.  There will be four rooms with a complete schedule of specialized content and highly qualified training sessions. 

This is just a snippet of what we are planning for you:
<br />
<br />

### Solution Architect's room 
Focused on more technical subjects, you'll learn about real cases and all the details behind the implementation of VTEX's main projects. And more: Gustavo Rios and Marcelo Couto will show everything they know about B2B, while Danilo Hirama and Débora Ferreira will make you deep dive on the inStore features. You'll also get to know the latest resources when it comes to checkout, marketplaces, and cross-border. 
<br />

### E-Commerce Manager's room 
Learn how to increase your store's conversion and performance. There'll be lectures about metrics, best practices, and the use of simple features that can boost your sales. To help make it all more tangible, Rodrigo Dellacqua will give examples of what our main clients have done to improve their results.
<br />

### Sales' room 
Where VTEX's main leaders will show their approach on the sales-speech for different markets. Some examples of what the room will host: Daniela Jurado talking about B2C, Núbia Mota telling more about VTEX OMS and the omnichannel experience VTEX is bringing to the table, and Gabriel Villa sharing all his experience with marketplaces.
<br />

### Developer's room 
The stage for VTEX IO, VTEX's development platform. Our engineers will explain all about app development, the platform extension points, DreamStore, AppStore, Pages, and the infrastructure behind it all.
