Shipping policies are sets of rules that define the shipping options and conditions that will be shown to the customer at checkout.

You can now configure the Delivery Capacity of your Shipping Policies to manage how many items or orders your store can deliver in each [Scheduled Delivery](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/entrega-agendada--22g3HAVCGLFiU7xugShOBi) window.

## What has changed?

Previously, it wasn’t possible to limit the number of items or orders that your store's shipping policies could accommodate in scheduled deliveries, and the control and management of scheduled deliveries had to be done outside of the VTEX platform. 

Now, you can create and edit a shipping policy with scheduled delivery, defining the number of items or orders that can be delivered in the time windows available, and you can manage them in the platform.

## Why did we make this change?

This change aims to ensure that our customers can track and limit the availability of scheduled deliveries. It is now possible to:

*   Limit the number of items or orders available for customers in scheduling windows.
*   Track the availability of each delivery window.
*   Manage the scheduled deliveries that have the delivery capacity feature configured.

## What needs to be done? 

To use the delivery capacity feature, you need to set up a shipping policy to enable scheduled deliveries, and then configure the delivery capacity.

To learn how to configure it for your scheduled deliveries, read the article [Delivery Capacity](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-capacidade-de-entrega--2y217FQZCjD0I1n62yxVcz).
