announcementSynopsisEN: 'Possibility to limit user access to the Settings screen'
---

>⚠️ From June 25 <sup>th</sup>, 2019, users without access to `Checkout` will not be allowed to edit the Settings tab on the Orders Management module.

Seeking to ensure greater safety, we created the possibility to limit user access to the **Settings** screen on the Orders Management module, allowing information to be edited by selected users only.

## Main Advantages 

You can now restrict access to this functionality, avoiding that users which do not have permission change informations such as the minimum amount of items in the cart or the minimum value of the cart. In addition, the new version ensures more oversight over the changes that are implemented on the **Settings** screen, since you can now choose who has editing privileges.

## What you need to do

Should you want to grant a user permission to edit the **Settings** screen on the Orders Management module, you must give this user the necessary access.

In order to do this, you need to add a product called `Checkout` to the desired profile by following these steps:

1. Access Account Management
2. Roles
3. Click on **New Profile** or select an already existing user
4. Click on **Configure other product**
5. From the dropdown menu, select `Checkout`
6. Choose the type of permission you wish to grant: either `Save Order Configuration` if you want to allow the user to edit the **Orders** secction, or `Save OrderForm Configuration` if you want the user to edit the **Cart** section.
7. Finally, click on **Save**.

Upon adding this new product to a profile, ensure that the desired users are in fact linked to this profile.
