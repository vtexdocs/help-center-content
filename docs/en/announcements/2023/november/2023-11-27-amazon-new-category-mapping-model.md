An important step in the [integration](/en/docs/tracks/amazon) between VTEX stores and Amazon is mapping categories and attributes, which consists of matching the products in your catalog with the offers available on Amazon.

To make the mapping process easier and more intuitive, we have developed the **[category and attribute mapping via VTEX Admin](/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-a-amazon--6sgd4Pagy3wNsWKBvmIFrP/5xklf2wSdeztQh4iy5kJvD?&utm_source=autocomplete#mapeamento-via-admin-vtex-beta),** which is available for VTEX stores in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. To access the new mapping model, go to **Marketplace > Marketplaces and Integrations > Amazon > Perform Mapping.** The instructions are available in the [Mapping and sending product categories to Amazon](/en/docs/tracks/sending-products-to-amazon) tutorial.  

## What has changed?

Previously, the mapping process could only be carried out [via spreadsheet](/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-a-amazon--6sgd4Pagy3wNsWKBvmIFrP/5xklf2wSdeztQh4iy5kJvD?&utm_source=autocomplete#mapeamento-via-planilha). Now, with the new mapping model, you can choose which type of mapping best meets your needs.  

Here are some of the advantages of mapping categories and attributes using the VTEX Admin:  

- Monitor the mapping status of each category.  
- Search for the category on Amazon to match it with your catalog.  
- Autofill the attributes that are already in your catalog.  
- Customize the shipping rate template by SKU.  

## What needs to be done?

The feature will be available to all [VTEX accounts that act as sellers](/en/docs/tutorials/marketplace-strategies-at-vtex#sendo-seller-vtex) from **December 18, 2023.** To use it, you need to have your VTEX account [integrated](/en/docs/tracks/amazon) with Amazon and send the products by following the [Mapping and sending product categories to Amazon](/en/docs/tracks/sending-products-to-amazon) tutorial.
