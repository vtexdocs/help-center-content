We introduce the **VTEX Sales App**, the new version of inStore, a unified commerce experience with in-store sales. The new VTEX Sales App includes all the features of the old inStore with a new Offers section and a redesigned menu.

## What has changed?

The improvements include a modernized checkout, performance tracking, and personalized marketing strategies.

### New menu

The new menu provides significant advantages, which are highlighted below:

- **Modern design:** Boxes with icons to easily identity items.
- **Intuitive navigation:** Improved layout to quickly find what you need.
- **Visual consistency:** Consistent look and feel aligned with other recent platform updates.

### Offers section

The Offers section allows merchants to display specific products or search results and customize their marketing strategies to their business needs and goals.

One of the key features of this update is that merchants can set the Offers section as their home page. This provides a more customized user experience, as customers are immediately greeted with selected content and product recommendations.
