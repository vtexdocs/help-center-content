To increase customer satisfaction by providing a seamless and convenient support experience, VTEX developed Live Support. 

[Live Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/conversational-commerce-vtex--5UZ9BdvwwtZm2t9QTXcbZs/1woBo299K5gvDG7MSa8HYL?&utm_source=autocomplete) is the Conversational Commerce configuration that enables customer  support via WhatsApp. This functionality is only available for BR and LATAM. 

## What has changed?

Previously, stores did not have automated WhatsApp support integration. Now, with the Live Support configuration, your customers can talk directly to a seller and have personalized support.

With this configuration, you can provide 24/7 support to your customers, even when you are not available. Live Support also allows you to:
- Customize your store's support between working hours. 
- Set up unavailability messages. 
- Create exceptions, indicating the unavailability windows.

## What needs to be done?
To get started, you must [activate Live Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/conversational-commerce-vtex--5UZ9BdvwwtZm2t9QTXcbZs/1woBo299K5gvDG7MSa8HYL?&utm_source=autocomplete) in your store and contact our [support](https://help.vtex.com/support) for [Zenvia and Zendesk integration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/conversational-commerce-vtex--5UZ9BdvwwtZm2t9QTXcbZs/SxhYiiqUJYiQX4CIWxmVE).
