VTEX periodically performs vulnerability checks through recurring scanning and penetration tests (_pen tests_). These procedures allow us to evaluate the level of security maturity of our platform.

If necessary, you can run a penetration test on your own — provided you are authorized by VTEX — and report any vulnerabilities found. To assist with this, the VTEX Security team has updated the procedure merchants should follow to perform a penetration test in their store environment.

## What has changed?

In summary, the new process for running penetration tests consists of:

1. Submit a request to schedule a test through [VTEX Support](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support).
2. Review and sign the [confidentiality agreement](https://assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5iw8rN7CdSn7PHKvMMcO19/ab46ae4025d506e052dcef5974f9007f/Pentest_NDA_.zip) before running any tests.
3. Once the test is complete, share the results with the VTEX Security team.

For more detailed information on this procedure, see the [Penetration tests and vulnerability notifications](/en/tutorial/penetration-testing-and-vulnerability-notice--6jodF6s1I50Fg84ZwutOCb) guide.

## Why did we make this change?

We have updated the penetration testing procedure to ensure the platform is secure and checks are run securely, preventing [unauthorized procedures](/en/tutorial/penetration-testing-and-vulnerability-notice--6jodF6s1I50Fg84ZwutOCb#unauthorized-procedures) and actions that could harm our customers.
