[Performance Monitor](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-getting-started-and-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/5pqtuvi97FFZiGf7MlSe8q) is the new VTEX Sales App feature. It allows your sales associates to know exactly how much they have sold through the solution and view key retail indicators, such as average ticket, average number of items per sale, and average amount per item.
It also shows your sales associates how their performance compares to your store average.

These data are also available to managers accessing the VTEX Admin to closely monitor the performance of their sales associates and stores.
# What has changed?
The Sales App's side menu now features the Sales Performance option, where sales associates can view their own sales performance and that of other employees.

# What needs to be done?
The feature is enabled by default for all accounts using the app. The only exception is for brands that already use the Indeva by VTEX solution, which requires contacting support to activate the feature.
