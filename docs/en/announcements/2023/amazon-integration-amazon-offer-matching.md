The [integration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-a-amazon) between VTEX stores and Amazon allows sellers to send their product catalog to the marketplace, which expands their sales channels. To increase the quality of offers shown on Amazon, we created a new page for VTEX sellers to do the product matching.

## What has changed?

Before, when a seller sent a product to the Amazon integration, it would go through an automatic matching process to link the seller SKU to the product ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) on Amazon. However, this process occasionally resulted in compatibility errors between the sent product and the published offer on Amazon.

With the new matching flow, the sellers approve the matches between their products and Amazon offers. Despite matching now being a manual process, sellers can approve SKUs in bulk.

## Why did we make this change?

The process will now be completely manual. This change aims to reduce compatibility errors, so sellers show reliable and quality offers on the marketplace, giving sellers control over how the sent products and the published offers are matched.

## What needs to be done?

You can find the Amazon Offer Matching page in Marketplace > __Amazon Offer Matching__ or through the search bar. The page will be available for all VTEX accounts as of July 03, 2023. No action is required to activate it.

For more information about how the page works, check the [documentation Amazon Offer Matching](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/match-de-anuncios-amazon--7fRfoP69kYgg8znImMhyQ0).
