Aiming to offer the best experience to our clients, we announce the deprecation of the VTEX Admin Offer Management module.
 
The offers sent to the marketplaces will not be affected, and you can still view the status of each one in the VTEX Admin under **Marketplace > Connections > Products.**
 
## What has changed?

We have removed the option of monitoring the status and synchronization of offers sent to a marketplace from the Offers Management module.  
The [Moderation](/en/tutorial/gerenciamento-de-anuncios-moderacao-e-qualidade-dos-anuncios-do-mercado--xSbPzA41jiWPAorlBCEA4?&utm_source=autocomplete#moderacao), [Offer Quality](/en/tutorial/gerenciamento-de-anuncios-moderacao-e-qualidade-dos-anuncios-do-mercado--xSbPzA41jiWPAorlBCEA4?&utm_source=autocomplete#qualidade), and [MeLi Catalog Opportunities](/en/tutorial/anuncios-enviados-oportunidades-de-buybox--1hO9eI1th47EGxQoTzGewC) features will remain available until December 15, 2023, only for offers linked to the [Mercado Libre integration](/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-do-mercado-livre--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq/51oWBHvVxSs8eAwLQhSbSd) through **Marketplace > Mercado Libre > Offer Management.**  
 
## What needs to be done?

This update is automatic, so no action is required from you. As of the date indicated above, the module will be completely discontinued from the VTEX Admin.  

> ℹ️ We will soon have a replacement module for Offer Management. Follow the updates through the [Release Notes page on the Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes) and the [News page in the VTEX Help Center](/en/announcements).
