---

Aiming to improve the merchant experience, we have implemented significant improvements in checkout resilience and reduced latency — the time it takes to transfer data from one point to another — for accounts using [Data Protection Plus](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/data-protection-plus), an architecture available in selected regions on [VTEX Shield](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-shield--2CVk6H9eY2CBtHjtDI7BFh). These performance enhancements are designed to increase the purchase conversion rate.

## What has changed?

We have successfully reduced the total latency of the sales flow for accounts using [Data Protection Plus](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/data-protection-plus) by approximately 55%, equivalent to 9800 ms. This improvement makes the checkout process more agile, allowing critical API calls to be made more quickly.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required, as the updates have been automatically applied to all accounts using [Data Protection Plus](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/data-protection-plus).
