**Projects** is the new feature in the Headless CMS that streamlines the management of multiple digital experiences, such as mobile apps, websites, and email marketing, from one control panel. 

![Projects overview](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3RgVmOuLr7SJmEfots0KMZ/c7ccee21dc6cae85a41886c49d9a3d8f/projects-two-en.png)

With Projects, you can customize each project's settings, content, and branding to specific audiences or purposes.

## What has changed
Before, to handle different projects with distinct target audiences or solutions, you had to access the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps** > **Extensions Hub** > **App Management**, and then search for the **CMS (alpha)** app. Within the **CMS (alpha)** app, each project required individual creation and settings.

Now, the **Projects** interface allows you to manage all your projects from a single dashboard, providing a centralized control panel where you can manage all projects. You can now easily switch between projects, adjusting settings, content, and identity in one place. This improvement makes you more adaptable, catering to different audiences and objectives.

## Why are we making this change?
The **Projects** interface brings the following improvements:

- To simplify the process of managing content across multiple projects.
- To centralize projects in one place.
- To effectively cater to specific audiences or objectives by having separate projects.

## What needs to be done?
The feature is already available for all accounts with Headless CMS installed. Refer to the [Managing Projects](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-projects--42IpDFqTVTESH8DCypJMPM) guide for more information on using the feature.
