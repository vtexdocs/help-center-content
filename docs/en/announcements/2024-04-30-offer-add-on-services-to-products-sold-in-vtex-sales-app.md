We have developed a new feature for [VTEX Sales App](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-assisted-sales-admin/p). It allows integration between online and physical sales channels, through which sales associates from physical stores can provide customized services to customers.

## What has changed?
With the Assembly Options feature, sellers can offer add-on services for their products, such as extended warranties and protection plans. It also makes it possible to assemble sets of multiple SKUs, such as Christmas or breakfast baskets, makeup sets, etc.

## Why did we make this change?
We developed this feature to allow sellers to offer product customization options through VTEX Sales App.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The feature is already available in VTEX Sales App.
For more information on how to use this feature, see the article [Assembly Options in VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/assembly-options-no-vtex-sales-app--4fTfqOMcXyhAhWXkl935lr).
