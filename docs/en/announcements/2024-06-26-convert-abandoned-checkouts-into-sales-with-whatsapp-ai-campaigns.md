We have developed a new feature: WhatsApp AI Campaigns. This new feature allows merchants to automatically send personalized reminders via WhatsApp to users who have not completed their orders.

These reminders are designed to motivate users to return to the payment page and complete their transactions, thus improving the shopping experience and boosting sales.

The new WhatsApp AI Campaigns feature offers improvements such as:
- **Custom messages:** Sends custom messages to users who haven't completed their orders.
- **Real-time monitoring:** Allows you to monitor campaign performance in real time via the VTEX dashboard.
- **Quick configuration:** Enables the feature without any coding.
- **Redirection after expiration:** Allows the user to be redirected to checkout even after their session has expired.

## What needs to be done?
The feature is now available for all stores using [Store Framework](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/store-development--3fHF3GIjK8UugnQKIakpl9/5DTcawNjc5MovtD7HNqURl#store-framework) that don't have Checkout customizations.  To implement it in your store, go to [Recovering abandoned checkouts with WhatsApp AI Campaigns](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/recovering-abandoned-checkouts-with-whatsapp-ai-campaigns--20i0zLQHt72LKzVEmk1CRZ?&utm_source=autocomplete).
