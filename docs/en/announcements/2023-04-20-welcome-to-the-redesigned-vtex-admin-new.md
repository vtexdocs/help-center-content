Digital businesses are increasingly looking for tools that can help them grow, while enabling their teams to focus on their core responsibilities. With this in mind, VTEX presents a new version of its Admin that allows merchants to manage their entire digital commerce experience in one place, in a simpler and smarter way, with significant improvements in accessing data and fulfilling daily tasks.

Welcome to the [redesigned Admin experience](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/?utm_source=announcement&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=new_admin_beta).

## What has changed?

We have combined the following experience improvements so merchants can control and manage their business:

* Simpler and more elegant design system.
* Reorganized menu and navigation.
* New business data dashboards.
* Redesigned pages to improve your daily operations.

Although we have redesigned the VTEX Admin, your store settings and data have not changed. All information previously found in your account will remain the same when you access the new Admin. We have changed the way we present installed modules in your interface, but their features remain the same.

### Changes in navigation menu

No page has been removed from the VTEX Admin, but we have reorganized the navigation menu to better match the most accessed pages and reflect your operation's priorities. Learn more about our [Enhanced navigation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-admin-start-here--5bBA7QgKuU2wL2Aq11pqAA).

You can use the search bar at the top of your VTEX Admin to search for specific pages. Pages that are not part of our standard edition of the VTEX Admin can also be found by accessing **Apps > Installed Apps.**

Besides reorganizing the order of pages, we have also changed some of the labels in the navigation menu to make them more consistent and aligned with VTEX capabilities. The table below lists the changes in page names.

## Why did we make this change?

Our goal is to bring consistency to your experience by reducing unnecessary complexity. To achieve this goal, we are redesigning several parts of the experience and implementing structural changes in how you navigate the VTEX Admin. The [new home page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/store-overview--P8ahguoRs0U3PzmXg2wuQ) was also redesigned to serve as a control panel for your entire business operation, with actionable data to inform your decisions.

## What needs to be done?

As of May 24, 2023, all VTEX stores will be automatically updated with the new Admin interface, and no action is required on your side.

After this date, it will not be possible to roll back to the old version of the interface.
