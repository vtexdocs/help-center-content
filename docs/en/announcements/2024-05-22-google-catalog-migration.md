We have developed the **Google catalog migration** feature to map and match sellers' products in the VTEX catalog with their ads on Google Shopping.

This feature is designed for sellers who previously integrated their store's products with Google via an external platform and are now using the [Google Shopping connector](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw) on VTEX.

## Why did we develop this feature?

This feature enables sellers to maintain the relevance of their Google Shopping ads. By migrating your integration to the VTEX connector, you preserve the relevance history of your ads.

>ℹ️ Catalog migration maps and matches products in the VTEX catalog with the existing ads in the Google Merchant Center.

Catalog migration maps and matches products in the VTEX catalog with the existing ads in the Google Merchant Center.

## What needs to be done?

To proceed with the migration, contact [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/pt/support). However, you must first complete the following two requirements:

1. Create a new trade policy without any associated products.
2. Set up the integration with Google Shopping using the trade policy created in the previous step.

After these steps, contact VTEX Support to request the migration. We will respond within four working days.

Once the migration is complete, you can add the SKUs you wish to advertise on Google Shopping to the integration’s trade policy.
