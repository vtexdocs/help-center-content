Offering promotions is a method to increase customer attraction and retention by giving advantages such as discounts and gifts. Having an overall promotion management view is fundamental to taking strategic decisions and planning this type of action.

With that in mind, we created the new Promotion List, which allows you to manage promotional actions efficiently and optimally.

The updated interface includes more information on the existing promotions in your store, improves the search and filter options and provides more actions, such as exporting and duplicating promotions.

## What has changed?

We developed a new interface for the Promotion List, which includes:

* Having a complete management view on your store's promotions and on the feature usage details, with an updated design for the [New VTEX Admin](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/?utm_source=announcement&utm_medium=help_center&utm_campaign=promotions_list).
* Easily finding your promotions using search and new filter options.
* Exporting your active promotions list.
* Duplicating active or archived promotions for a faster creation process.

## Why did we make this change?
