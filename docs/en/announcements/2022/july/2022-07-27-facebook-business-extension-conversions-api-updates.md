The [Facebook Business Extension](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-facebook-fbe/p) app, available for free in the VTEX App Store, allows you to streamline the integration between VTEX stores and the Facebook Manager platform, making it easier to offer products in yet another sales channel.

One of the features of the Facebook Business Extension is the [Conversions API](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2041148702652965), which allows you to detect navigation info of users accessing your store.

The Conversions API can now detect new events. These events correspond to the stages of a purchase process — the user's full journey, from searching for a product to completing a purchase.

The upgrade aims to maximize the reliability of collected data and data mapping for the user's journey, and optimize strategies for events that reflect your store's business goals. This will allow you to display ads to users who are more likely to perform actions in your store.

## What has changed?

Previously, stores using the Conversions API could only measure navigation data related to the "Purchase" event — when users complete a purchase. Now you can also measure the following events:

| **Event** | **Description** |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| PageView | When the user views a product page. |
| View Content | When the user views content. |
| Search | When the user uses the search box. |
| Add to Cart | When the user adds a product to their shopping cart. |
| Initiate Checkout | When the user enters their payment information. |

## Why did we make this change?

We have added new events to the Conversions API to:

- Increase the performance of the target audience reach.
- Optimize and measure campaigns with information from users who have accessed your website.
- Boost the reliability of collected data.
- Draw parallels between the data collected and the user journey.
- Impact potential preferred consumers with your ads.

## What needs to be done?

The app is available globally, fully compatible with all stores using [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and partially compatible with Legacy or [Headless](https://vtex.com/en/blog/strategy/headless-commerce-what-it-is-and-why-its-growing-so-fast/) [CMS](/en/docs/tracks/what-is-the-cms) stores. To identify in which model your store operates, access the [Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app).

The update is now automatically available for stores already using the Facebook Business Extension. If you want to integrate your VTEX store with FBE, follow the steps in the article [Integration with Facebook Business Extension](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook-business-extension--2hS3ANSZ7vlHCcba4h7k8D).
