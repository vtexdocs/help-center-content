We have launched the new *Satisfaction Survey* page in the VTEX Admin. Now, you can rate our support service without leaving the VTEX environment.

![Pesquisa de satisfação EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2022/2022-01-13-rate-vtexs-service-in-your-admin_1.png)

## What has changed?

Before, it was only possible to rate VTEX's service through the survey sent to your email. We have created the *Satisfaction Survey* page in your VTEX Admin, so you can:

- Rate VTEX's support through our *Satisfaction Survey* page after each ticket is resolved.    
- View a list of resolved tickets submitted by you on behalf of your store.   
- Access the [Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/), [VTEX Community](https://community.vtex.com/), and [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/).

For now, the page only displays the support tickets that have already been resolved.

## Why did we make this change?

The *Satisfaction survey* is a way for us to get closer to you and hear your opinion about our support, connecting our service to your feedback to improve your experience.

## What needs to be done?

The new *Satisfaction Survey* page is already installed in your VTEX Admin by default. To access it, go to **Account settings** and click on **Satisfaction survey**.

We have also sent you an email invitation to visit the page and give your rating.
