Continuing with the improvements that were completed for the [Mercado Libre certification](/en/announcements/2021-08-23-vtex-is-now-officially-a-certified-mercado-libre-partner-in-brazil), we are launching the new Mercado Libre size chart for all VTEX stores that operate as sellers on the marketplace.

The size chart allows customers to find out the approximate measurement of the product they're buying, which provides a better experience when selecting product size.

Currently, the size chart is only available for the Shoes category.

## What has changed?

Before the size chart was available, you had to use Mercado Libre's platform to create a size chart for your products.

Now, you can create size charts in the new category and attribute mapping interface.

## Why did we make this change?

This change is part of the scope of improvements for the Mercado Libre integration after the certification, and it is aimed at creating a better experience for our clients.

This is another step for providing a completely centralized management experience for the whole integration from a single dashboard in the VTEX Admin.

## What needs to be done?

The new interface is already available in the VTEX Admin for all our customer base that use the Mercado Libre connector for offering their products. To access it, click **MARKETPLACE > Integrations > Settings** and, on the Mercado Libre box, click `Map`.

To learn more about how to use the new interface, check the article [Sending products to Mercado Libre](/en/docs/tracks/mapping-product-categories-and-attributes-to-mercado-libre).

This page follows VTEX's new Design System, which has a cleaner, more modern, user-friendly look and feel.
