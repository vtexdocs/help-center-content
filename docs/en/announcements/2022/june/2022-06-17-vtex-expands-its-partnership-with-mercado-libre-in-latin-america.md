Mercado Libre is one of the leaders in ecommerce in Latin America. It offers ecommerce solutions for buying, selling, paying for, advertising, and shipping products online for end-users and businesses.

The integration with Mercado Libre is an opportunity to leverage product reach and benefit from the customer base of the marketplace. Using [VTEX’s Mercado Libre native connector](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), you can manage the entire business through a single dashboard while having guaranteed usability and integrity. As a certified partner, the integration will always be up-to-date with the newest features released by Mercado Libre.

Currently, besides Brazil, VTEX is a certified Mercado Libre integration partner in the following Latin American countries:

- Argentina
- Chile
- Colombia 
- Peru

The certification ensures that the VTEX integration has reached the standards of excellence required by Mercado Libre. In practice, the certification guarantees that the solution is ready for [omnichannel](/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv) and new releases by Mercado Libre.

Some certification benefits include:

- **Specialized support from the Mercado Libre team:** with the certification, VTEX has access to more agile and specialized support from the Mercado Libre team.
- **Certified partner seal:** Mercado Libre performs a series of validations to ensure that the integration supports its main functionalities. Therefore, the certified partner seal proves to our customers that we have a solution that will meet their needs.
- **Certified VTEX team:** the VTEX team that developed the solution was also certified through a validation that proves our extensive knowledge of Mercado Libre’s open platform, improving the integration maintenance.

## What has changed?

- Mercado Envios Full support.

- New interface for managing promotional campaigns in Mercado Libre.
- New interface for mapping categories and attributes.
- Improvements to the status update flow for ME1 and ME2 orders.

## Why did we make this change?
