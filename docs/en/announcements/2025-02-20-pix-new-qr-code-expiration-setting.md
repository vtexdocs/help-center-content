---

To improve payment operations on the platform, VTEX will implement a new setting for customizing the expiration time of the Pix QR Code (a Brazilian payment method).

## What will change?

Currently, the Pix QR Code is available to the user for 10 minutes on the screen, while the payment can be completed in a maximum of 15 minutes. After this window, the order is canceled, and the user must make a new purchase.

After __March 26, 2025__, the Pix QR Code expiration can be set to any value between 15 and 60 minutes, allowing customers greater payment flexibility.

To configure the new Pix QR Code expiration, the payment provider must indicate the desired time, in seconds, in the `delayToCancel` field in the [Create Payment](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payment-provider-protocol#post-/payments) endpoint for every new transaction.

Example:

If you want all new Pix QR Code payments generated by the store to be paid within 30 minutes (1,800 seconds), the `delayToCancel` field needs to have the value `1800` in the provider response.

## What needs to be done?

Before __March 26, 2025__, check if the store payment provider is completing `delayToCancel` field in the authorization responses and follow the guidelines below:

- __The `delayToCancel` field of the [Create Payment](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payment-provider-protocol#post-/payments) endpoint is returning a value less than or equal to 15 minutes (900 seconds) for Pix__: No action is required. Expiration will remain set to 15 minutes. If you want to change this period, contact your payment provider to request the change to the desired value.

- __The `delayToCancel` field of the [Create Payment](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payment-provider-protocol#post-/payments) endpoint is returning a value greater than 15 minutes (900 seconds) for Pix__: Check if the declared value meets the current needs of the store and, if necessary, contact the payment provider to change it.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The configured value must be between 15 minutes (900 seconds) and 60 minutes (3600 seconds).
</div>

After __March 26, 2025__, the Pix QR Code expiration will be set to the value returned by your payment provider in the `delayToCancel` field of the [Create Payment](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payment-provider-protocol#post-/payments) endpoint.
