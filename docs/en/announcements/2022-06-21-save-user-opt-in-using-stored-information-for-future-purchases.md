To comply with consumer data privacy laws, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe and LGPD (General Data Protection Law) in Brazil, VTEX has developed the **Save user data opt-in** feature. With this solution, customers can decide whether to store their data in the store when making a purchase.

## What has changed?

Previously, after customers entered their information at checkout or after their first purchase, the store automatically saved their data without requiring confirmation. 

From now on, two checkboxes will be available on the Checkout screen, allowing users to indicate if they want their personal and payment information to be stored and used for future purchases. This will reduce your customers' shopping time.

##  What needs to be done?

To enable the **Save user data opt-in** feature in your store, you need to change the `savePersonalDataAsOptIn` parameter in the Checkout `orderForm` object. Learn more in the article [Save user data opt-in on Checkout](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/enable-the-save-user-data-opt-in).
