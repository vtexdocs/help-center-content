Since March 13th, 2020, VTEX IO and VTEX IO Store Framework documentation is no longer available in VTEX Help Center.

The documentation can be accessed in [**VTEX IO Docs**](https://vtex.io/docs), our documentation platform where all content related to both solutions is available. 

![vtex-io-docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_1.png)

## Why the change?

Online since 2016, our Help Center has become the official VTEX documentation platform for retailers, agencies, developers and other users that are interested in finding out more about our services and functionalities.

With the progressive evolution of our product and ecosystem, it became clear that we needed to come up with **more in-depth and more narrowly focused documentation** aimed at helping specific users reach their objective on the VTEX platform form.

The decision to remove VTEX IO and VTEX IO Store Framework documentation from Help Center and migrate it to VTEX IO Docs is the result of VTEX's effort to **merge the various documentation platform experiences our users have into one**, and thus better serve the specific needs of each experience. 

## Developer Portal - Merging VTEX development experiences

Home to our [API documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/reference), [guides](https://developers.vtex.com/docs) aimed at developers working with integrations and customization, and the [Release Notes](https://developers.vtex.com/changelog), which are synced with all the latest updates about our product, the [**Developer Portal**](https://developers.vtex.com) - formerly known as Help Center Developer Docs - offers all the necessary resources for VTEX's most advanced users in a single place. 

![developer-portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_2.png)

Aiming to improve VTEX development experience, the Developer Portal will soon incorporate the VTEX IO and VTEX IO Store Framework documentation - which is available today on VTEX IO Docs.

Such changes to VTEX's documentation platforms mean a lot more than just content redistribution: these changes ensure a **better and greater support for VTEX users** and their various business objectives on our platform.
