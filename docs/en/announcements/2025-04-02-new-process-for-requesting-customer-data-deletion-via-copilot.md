Starting **April 09, 2025**, merchants will be able to request the deletion of customer personal data directly through Copilot. This new feature was developed to simplify and streamline deletion requests, while keeping compliance with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## What will change?

Currently, deleting customer personal data is requested by opening a ticket with VTEX Support, following a manual process. Starting **April 09, 2025**, authorized merchants can request data deletion directly through Copilot, making the process faster and simpler. 

## What needs to be done?

Only authorized merchants will be able to request customer data deletion through Copilot. To grant this permission, you will need to create a [custom role](/en/tutorial/criar-perfil-de-acesso) named **General Data Protection Law** with the following resources from [License Manager](/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources):
- **Write user rights requests** (from the **User Rights** product)
- **Open Support Ticket** (from the **VTEX Support** product)

Next, assign this role to the merchants who will request customer data deletion.

More details will be available in the updated documentation [Deleting customer data](/en/tutorial/erasing-customer-data--1R9Fn7A06Ifj4R9YD4JTKU) on April 09.
