announcementSynopsisEN: 'Configuration to include and exclude sellers in promotions'
---

VTEX stores can now define which sellers a promotion does not apply to. 

Previously, it was only possible to include sellers in the promotion. This change aims to give stores more control over the affected sellers.

Configuration before the update:

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img
           src="https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2vhukfvaRA6F6aoa1zA0jj/fbffb2976972972a7c86b259f8a7d033/seller-promo-EN.png" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt = "Configuração de sellers na promoção">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">
      <em>
        The promotion module only allowed you to include affected sellers.
      </em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Configuration after the update:

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img
           src="https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/233U9aja4gDKtrBge4c0tl/d114d8774fa855551fd16b7d32c5be21/seller-promo-EN2.png" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt = "Configuração de sellers na promoção">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">
      <em>
        You can now exclude sellers from a promotion.
      </em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## What do I have to do?

Your store doesn't need to take any action to adapt to this change. This new feature just brings a new configuration option for your promotions.
