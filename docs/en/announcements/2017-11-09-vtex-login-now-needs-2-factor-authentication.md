As of __November 16__, at 2:00 p.m. (Brazil time), 2-factor authentication (2FA) becomes mandatory for all emails in VTEX Admin.

>ℹ️ Check the article on [how to enable 2FA](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/enabling-2-factor-authentication-login).

2FA is an authentication method that greatly increases the security of your store. That's because, at the moment of login, in addition to requesting email and password, the system requires an access key generated by application or SMS.

Without 2FA, someone would only need your email and password to have full access to your store account.

Although 2FA works through app and SMS, we strongly recommend that you choose the app authentication option so that you do not depend on telephone infrastructure.

Using the app, the access key will always be available when needed.

The key will be requested only every 3 days, provided that the computer and browser settings don't change.
