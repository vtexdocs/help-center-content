It is now possible to create Price Tables in a more intuitive, practical and fast way.

## What changes
Before, to create a Price Table, it was necessary to acess the Prices module filter and enter the name of the table to be created. Now, we've added a new __Price Table__ button that allows you to create and select the price table you want to view.

## Advantages

In this update, you can create, find and view price tables more quickly and conveniently. The new button displays a very intuitive interface, which simplifies the user experience in managing Price Tables.
