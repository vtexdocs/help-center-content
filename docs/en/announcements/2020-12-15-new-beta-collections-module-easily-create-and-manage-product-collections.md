We developed the [new Beta Collections module](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-collections-beta--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye) as a renewed alternative to the configurations made through CMS. Now we have a module dedicated to Collections with new features and available in beta version. This module allows you to:

- Add products to your collection via spreadsheet.
- Export your collection as a spreadsheet.
- Schedule your collection.
- Refine products and collections with new filters.

The new module allows you to create and edit collections in a simpler and easier way. Some of its features include:

- __A new way to create collections__: Easily add products from the catalog, make changes, search, and disable collections with just a few clicks.
- __"My Collections" dashboard__: View your active collections, the products included in each collection, as well as the order in which they appear to end users in your store.
- __Smart Filters__: Combine product specifications - such as category, brand, and material or fabric - to create new collections or remove products from existing ones.
- __Usability and design improvements__: Organize products in your collection by using the drag & drop functionality or by performing bulk actions.
- __Advanced Collections Search__: Easily find existing collections with the autocomplete feature, searching by term and reference.

## Why use the Collections module?

By grouping related products into collections, you create a discovery process for your customers, leading them to find new products and buy more, with a better shopping experience.

## What changes?

You will have a more dynamic experience when managing collections.

## What do I need to do?

This feature is in beta and available for environments starting from Admin v3. If you have any questions, please [contact our Support team](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests).
