When setting up the Mercado Libre [integration](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/configurar-integracao-do-mercado-livre--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq), sellers sends their catalog to the marketplace. Once the products are submitted and the offers are created, Mercado Libre shows **catalog** match opportunities to the seller, which can be highlighted in the marketplace. To analyze an opportunity, sellers need to access the VTEX Admin and go to **Marketplace > Mercado Libre > Offer Match**  or type **Offer Match** in the search bar.
