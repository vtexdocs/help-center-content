In digital commerce, retailers frequently update prices to keep a product competitive. The faster prices change, the greater the chance of converting sales.

On VTEX, you can change the price many times a day according to your store's strategy. In the Prices module, you can add or change the [base](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3XcXp0r5WrJvogB8KIX4Kx) or [fixed prices](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3XcXp0r5WrJvogB8KIX4Kx) using:

- VTEX Admin
- Price spreadsheet
- Pricing API

You can add prices via spreadsheet in two steps, exporting and importing. The price export had its experience improved with new features to give the user more visibility about the status of each price export spreadsheet.

## What has changed?

The following improvements to the price export experience allow you to:

- Track in real-time each price export and its percentage of completion.
- View the export history of the last 24 hours.
- Download the spreadsheet directly from the interface.
- Cancel the export.

## Why did we make this change?

The changes were made to:

- **Fix errors in exporting spreadsheets:** The spreadsheets were not always sent to the user's email, preventing the export from being completed.
- **Provide more visibility when exporting:** The users didn't have visibility of the spreadsheet export progress.
- **Improve the experience:** There's a new interface with messages about the progress of the price export, providing the user with clarity about possible errors and how to solve them.

## What needs to be done?

The new price export experience is available for all VTEX customers. To access it, go to the VTEX Admin under *Catalog > Prices > Price List* and click the <i class="fas fa-download"></i> icon to export prices.
