We've updated the Product Detail Page (PDP) of [VTEX Sales App](/en/tracks/instore-usando-o-app--4BYzQIwyOHvnmnCYQgLzdr/6cq4E1JCmA6vCvBCCtAgIM) to improve the browsing experience, simplify the information display, and optimize features.

## What has changed?

Previously, the Product Detail Page (PDP) displayed a limited amount of information and didn't offer advanced support for promotions, additional services, or customization.

Now, we've integrated new features and improvements, such as:

- **Promotion support:** Adds promotional tags to identify offers directly on the PDP.
- **Customization and attachments:** Allows you to customize products and add relevant attachments directly on the PDP.
- **Buy together:** Displays combinations of the most relevant offers to encourage customers to make additional purchases.
- **Other offers:** Displays the available alternatives to the main product.
- **Delivery and pickup:** Displays clear shipping and pickup details based on the customer's postal code, allowing you to sort [pickup points](/en/tutorial/como-funcionam-pontos-de-retirada--2fljn6wLjn8M4lJHA6HP3R) by the closest, cheapest, or fastest option.
- **Performance and interface:** Reduces loading times and renews the design for smoother navigation.
- **Inventory display adjustments:** Corrects inventory information for products available for delivery or pickup, including immediate pickup (*On Hands*).

## What needs to be done?

No action is required, as the improvements will be automatically applied to all stores using **VTEX Sales App**.
