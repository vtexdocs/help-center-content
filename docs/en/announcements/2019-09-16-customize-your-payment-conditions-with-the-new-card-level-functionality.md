Starting July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2019, special payment conditions can count on the new __Card Level__ functionality.

Retailers can now establish specific installment criteria for different segments of a determined card.

The new functionality is associated to the special "Issuing Bank" condition and is optional. It means the retailer can set such a payment condition without necessarily filling in the Card Level field.

## What changes?

Previously, installments for a purchase were solely related to the BIN code, defined by the first six numbers of a card.

This sequence is a worldwide practice that identifies the __bank__ and the __card association brand__. This allows retailers to configure special conditions based merely on these two pieces of information.

However, the Card Level adds an extra level of customization to the above-mentioned configurations, allowing retailers to create even more customized payment conditions for their business.

## How it works

The configuration is similar to other special payment configurations, with the main difference being that after choosing the country and issuing bank, the retailer can select between Card Level options made available by the chosen financial institution.

For more details on how to configure this feature, read on article on [setting up Special Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456).
