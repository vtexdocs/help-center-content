Ensuring your store is always in compliance with security and transparency best practices, VTEX has launched a new audit feature, **Audit**. 

![Screenshot for Audit UI for announcement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2021-10-21-transparency-and-security-with-the-new-audit-module_1.png)

From now on, users with the admin role can check operations performed in their store in a simple and fast way. You can create multiple search filters to make it easier to search for events and increase the speed of auditing processes.

These filters allow you to search for all the operations performed by a determined author in the last week or see who made the latest changes by module (Prices, OMS, Catalog, etc.).

Because of this flexibility, Audit has a Guide tab showing more examples of possible searches. For retailers' convenience, the feature also allows you to save searches to your favorites, share them, and export each event to the clipboard.
