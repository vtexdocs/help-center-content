announcementSynopsisEN: 'VTEX clients will be able to provide their customers with two new payment methods through the Adyen gateway.'
---

From November 2020, VTEX provides two new payment methods - Klarna Pay Now and Klarna Pay Later, both from Klarna, the leading Swedish payment solution on the European market.

VTEX uses Adyen as the gateway responsible for processing payments made through Klarna. Clients who have this affiliation can offer their customers the two new checkout payment methods.

## Klarna Pay Now

Klarna Pay Now is an instant payment option. By installing the Klarna app, users can make online purchases similar to those made using a debit card.

When a purchase is completed, customers will be redirected from VTEX checkout to the Klarna environment, where they can pay without logging in. The bank transfer is made automatically.  

## Klarna Pay Later
Klarna Pay Later is a payment method that enables payments by invoice.

At checkout, customers will also be redirected to the Klarna environment where they can choose one of three payment options: pay in 30 days, 6-36 month financing or four interest-free payments.

## How does it work 
Both Klarna Pay Now and Klarna Pay Later can be configured as a payment method in the Admin.
