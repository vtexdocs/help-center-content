---

A website's loading time is a key contributor to whether users stay on the page they are browsing, affecting store sales and conversion rate, as well as the findability of pages through SEO.

Therefore, performance should come under constant consideration: **the faster store content is delivered to end users, the bigger the potential gains for your e-commerce**.

## What changed?

VTEX Store Framework now has a set of **new configurations that are capable of optimizing the loading time of your store components**.

The new configurations allow for: 

- Content to be loaded in the browser only after user interaction (lazy load rendering);
- Optimizing images for rendering;
- Optimizing data fetching by components.

Once adopted, they will:

- Directly impact user browsing experience, leading to an increase in conversion rates;
- Improve by up to 80% your site's SEO classification;
- Decrease page loading time by up to 50%.

## What do I need to do?

To configure these new performance improvements in your store using Store Framework, access our documentation on [**Improving your store's performance**](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-best-practices-for-optimizing-performance) in [Developer Portal](https://vtex.io/docs/home).
