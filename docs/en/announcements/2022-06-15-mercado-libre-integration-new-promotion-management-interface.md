Continuing with the improvements implemented for the [Mercado Libre certification](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/vtex-agora-e-oficialmente-um-parceiro-certificado-do-mercado-livre-no-brasil--34D14K2Y6ogJs3OxKpQUrJ), we are officially launching the new interface for managing Mercado Libre promotions for all VTEX customers who operate as sellers on the marketplace.

On the new Mercado Libre **Promotions** page, you can manage a list of different promotional campaigns on the platform available for your store.

## What has changed?

Before having a Mercado Libre Promotions page, our clients had to use the Mercado Libre platform to track and participate in the promotions available in the marketplace.

With the new promotion management interface, our clients can track and participate in promotions available on the Mercado Libre platform without leaving the VTEX Admin environment.

## Why did we make this change?

This change is part of the improvements that were implemented for the Mercado Libre certification and is in line with our goal to provide a single control panel for all integration features. 

## What needs to be done?

The new interface is already available to our entire customer base that uses the Mercado Libre connector to offer their products. To access it, go to **MARKETPLACE > Mercado Libre > Promotions**.

To learn more about how to use the new feature, check the article [Mercado Libre promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/promocoes-do-mercado-livre-beta--3pEqEnru6H2JcZzYVioT5f).
