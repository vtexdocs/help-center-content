---

Google Pay payment is now available for VTEX stores. This new native integration allows merchants to provide customers with a faster and more secure checkout experience.

Google Pay uses Tokens instead of actual card numbers linked to the user's device. This increases approval rates and significantly reduces fraud. 

Additionally, it has millions of registered cards stored securely in the Google Wallet, making them available for one-click payments on any website or app that offers the "Pay with Google Pay" button.

## What has changed?

Google Pay is a digital wallet platform and online payment system developed by Google to enable in-app and tap-to-pay purchases on mobile devices, allowing users to pay via Android phones, tablets, or watches.

Now, you can add Google Pay as a payment method to your store, giving customers a faster and more convenient checkout process.

## What needs to be done?
