VTEX changed how the `availableQuantity` field works, which is returned by the API routes of the legacy search. This change may impact existing integrations.

>ℹ️ Stores that use VTEX Intelligent Search are not affected.

## What has changed?

The `availableQuantity` field no longer represents the exact number of available items in the store inventory. The field now returns an estimate based on order of magnitude. The possible values for `availableQuantity` are:

- `0`: 0 inventory quantity.
- `1`: inventory quantity of 1.
- `10`: inventory quantity between 2 and 10.
- `100`: inventory quantity between 11 and 100.
- `99999`: inventory quantity above 100.

This change affects all routes that return this field:

- [Search for products](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/search-api#get-/api/catalog_system/pub/products/search/-search-?endpoint=get-/api/catalog_system/pub/products/search/-search-)

## Why did we make this change?

Previously, it was possible to check the product quantity in a store inventory through the legacy API. However, since inventory is a sensitive piece of data and the API is public, we decided to hide it.

## What needs to be done?

If your store has any integration that returns the `availableQuantity` field in any of the routes mentioned above, check the feature to take into account the new behavior.
