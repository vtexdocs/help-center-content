We have made available two new features for VTEX Sales App: custom displays by store and collection. These features have been developed to enhance product display and improve the customer shopping experience:
- **Custom display by store:** Merchants can now highlight a product page by specifying the store ID to which the product will be linked in [Master Data](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/master-data-introduction), allowing them to create customized custom displays tailored to each store.
- **Collection custom display:** Enables you to manage a section of the custom display using a specific [collection from the catalog](/en/tutorial/criando-colecao-de-produtos--tutorials_244). Merchants can set the custom display name and collection identifier, making it easier to organize products and highlight collections to customers.

## Why did we make this change?
We developed these features to help merchants efficiently create customized offers and organize their custom displays around product collections.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required, as the feature will be automatically applied to all stores using VTEX Sales App. For more information, please see the [VTEX Sales App announcements](/en/tutorial/anuncios-do-vtex-sales-app--3UtOFwbwD4muz3p72RBPmC).
