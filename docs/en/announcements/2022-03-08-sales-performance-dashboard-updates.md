The Sales Performance dashboard allows store operators to analyze data from all the store's sales channels and sellers, including metrics on revenue, orders, average ticket, and more. 

We have improved the experience on this page based on your suggestions, adding new features for applying filters, customizing views, and exploring data.

## What has changed?
We have enhanced existing features, such as Filters and Data, and added the Views menu. The new filter experience allows you to try different filter combinations with fewer clicks. The new Views feature has been designed to save the filters and metrics applied on the page, allowing you to access the same view combination quickly. 

Check out the features we have added for each component:

### Filters 
- Apply the new filter options: Campaign and Coupon.
- See which filters are active on the page when browsing the charts.

### Data
- View the data in almost real time, with a delay of no more than 40 minutes.
- Switch the metrics view between the options Percentage, Absolute or Representative and sort it in ascending or descending order. 

### Views 
- Browse views already saved, such as: Sales Management, Seller 3p Management, Sales Channel Management, Category Management, Fulfillment Management.
- Create, edit, and share custom views.

## Why did we make this change?
We have updated the Sales Performance dashboard experience so that retailers can analyze data more in a more fluid way and with less effort. These improvements to the page's interface were motivated by suggestions given by our customers while listening to their experiences.

In addition, the new filter and visualization options allow custom data analysis, reflecting the reality of each business.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The page has been automatically updated in your VTEX Admin. Learn more in the article Sales Performance.
