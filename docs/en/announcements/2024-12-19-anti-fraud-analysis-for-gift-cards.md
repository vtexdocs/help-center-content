---

VTEX has implemented fraud analysis features for purchases made using [gift cards](/en/tutorial/gift-card--tutorials_995) to improve payment operations on the platform.

## What has changed?

From now on, in addition to analyzing credit and debit card payment transactions, the [Anti-fraud Provider Protocol](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/how-the-integration-protocol-between-vtex-and-antifraud-companies-works) allows [anti-fraud providers](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-the-anti-fraud--tutorials_446) to offer the fraud analysis service for gift card transactions, increasing the security level of your store for this payment method.

## What needs to be done?

The anti-fraud analysis for gift card transactions is now available in all VTEX accounts. To enable it in your store, you need to:

1. Contact your anti-fraud provider to check whether this anti-fraud analysis service is already available. Learn more about the required settings for the anti-fraud provider in [New feature available for anti-fraud providers: Gift card transaction analysis](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes/2024-12-19-new-feature-available-for-anti-fraud-providers-gift-card-transaction-analysis).
2. Associate the anti-fraud provider with the gift card payment method in the VTEX Admin. Learn more in [Configuring the anti-fraud](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-the-anti-fraud--tutorials_446).
