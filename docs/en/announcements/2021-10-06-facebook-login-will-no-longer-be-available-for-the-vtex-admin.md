announcementSynopsisEN: 'The Facebook login feature for the VTEX Admin has been suspended'
---


Over time, experience shows us that some features are little used, and, consequently, their maintenance becomes counterproductive for VTEX and its customers.

Therefore, after an objective and thorough analysis, we have decided to remove the Facebook login feature from all VTEX admin panels. It has already been removed from the newest version of the admin panel, and we will now remove it from the previous version as well. This way, we can make the user experience simpler and easier, and our staff can focus on what really matters to our clients.

## What will change

The Facebook login feature will be removed from all versions of the VTEX admin panel.

>ℹ️ The Facebook login feature will still be available for customers to log in to your VTEX store.

## Why are we making this change?

We have observed that this feature is rarely used and we estimate that the impact caused by removing it will be low, as we offer multiple login alternatives for VTEX store admin users. These alternatives are more widely used and are constantly improved. Because of this, we have decided to no longer offer Facebook login as an option for VTEX admin panels.

## What needs to be done?

All users who use Facebook to log in to the VTEX Admin will have to choose from other available login options, such as:

- Access code
- Email and password
- Google login
