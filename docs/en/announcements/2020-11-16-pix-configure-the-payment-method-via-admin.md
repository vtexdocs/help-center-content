---

Starting November 2020, VTEX clients will be able to configure Pix - the Central Bank of Brazil (Bacen) instant payment method - via Admin. 

Pix is an innovative payment method available nationwide in Brazil that enables users to make bank transfers within 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The new feature brings many benefits to retailers. You can check all of those in our blogpost about [the impacts of Pix on e-commerce](https://vtex.com/pt-br/blog/produto/pix-no-e-commerce/ "the impacts of Pix on ecommerce"). 

## What has changed?

Up until now, Pix was used for testing purposes only. From November 16, the Central Bank of Brazil will make the full instant payment operation available throughout the country.

Stores that want can thus configure Pix as a payment method via Admin at any time. 

Within 15 minutes, Pix can be enabled as a payment method, allowing your customers to use it when placing orders on SmartCheckout.

## How does it work?

Ensure that your payment processing partner is correctly [integrated](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/pix-instant-payments-in-brazil "integrated") using the [Payment Provider Protocol](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/payment-provider-protocol "Payment Provider Protocol") - VTEX's integration protocol. 

If so, you can proceed with configuring Pix. The process is similar to that of other payment methods offered.
