VTEX's License Manager now has __Security Wizard__, a new feature that helps you manage who has access to your store's admin. You can find it in the module's main page, where it shows all users who haven't logged in in the previous 60 days.

With that information, you can decide if the displayed users still need access to the platform and, therefore, revise their permissions. You can also choose to not perform any actions on a certain user. In this case, __Security Wizard__ will not show that person's data for another 60 days.

This new feature brings more security to your store, especially because it makes it easier to understand and control who has access to it's data.
