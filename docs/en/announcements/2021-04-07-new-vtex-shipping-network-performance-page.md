The VTEX Shipping Network solution allows you to track the performance of the shipping carriers that deliver your customers' orders. The **Performance** functionality uses metrics to analyze the efficiency of the services provided by VTEX Shipping Network carriers and external carriers.

## What has changed?

The way in which performance is calculated has been changed. Now the performance analysis considers only completed deliveries. 

The graphical presentation and description of each carrier in the performance table have been updated to make it easier to view each carrier's data.

Also, new columns were included in the performance table to differentiate between deliveries that are delayed from deliveries in progress.

## Why did we make this change?

We have made this change to provide our clients with a clearer, more fluid experience when tracking results, in order to ensure that performance metrics are efficient. 

By comparing carrier services, you can:

*   Track performance calculation through more effective results.
*   Check the detailed performance of all carriers.
*   View carrier information clearly and simply.

## What needs to be done?

This update process will be implemented natively. No action is required on your side.
