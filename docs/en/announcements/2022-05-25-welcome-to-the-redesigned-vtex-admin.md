Digital businesses are increasingly looking to have tools that will be allies for them to grow, having their team focusing on its core. That is why VTEX introduces a new version of its Admin, to allow merchants to manage their entire digital commerce experience, all in one place, in a simpler and smarter way, with significant improvements in accessing data and fulfilling daily tasks.

Welcome to the [Redesigned Admin experience](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/).

## What has changed?

We have combined the following experience improvements so merchants can control and manage their business:

- Simpler and more elegant design system.

- Reorganized menu and navigation.

- New commerce data dashboards.

- Redesigned pages to improve your daily operations.

Although we have redesigned the VTEX Admin, your store settings and data have not changed. If you participate in our Beta program, when you log in to redesigned Admin, all information previously found in your account remains the same.

### Redesigned pages

For the Beta program, we have redesigned pages in the following modules to match our new design system:

* Dashboard
* Orders
* Catalog
* Promotions
* Intelligent Search 

The other pages present in your Admin experience will be redesigned throughout 2022.

### Changes in navigation menu

No page has been removed from the VTEX Admin, but we have reorganized the navigation menu, to better match the most accessed pages and reflect your operation's priorities. Learn more about our [Enhanced Navigation](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/admin-v4-start-here--3hVvfesyGq1RXkfzzh8o4k#Enhanced%20Navigation).

```
You can use the search bar at the top bar of your VTEX Admin to search for specific pages. Pages that are not a part of our standard edition of the VTEX Admin can also be found by accessing Apps > Installed Apps.  
```

Besides reorganizing the order of pages, we have also changed some of the labels in the navigation menu, so they are more consistent and aligned with VTEX functionalities. The tables below list changes in section and page names.

## Why did we make this change?

Our goal is to bring consistency to your experience by reducing unnecessary complexity and correcting significant localization gaps. To achieve this goal, we are redesigning several parts of the experience and implementing structural changes in how you navigate the VTEX Admin. The new home page was also redesigned to serve as a control panel for your entire commerce operation, with actionable data to inform your decisions. 

## What needs to be done?

If you would like to participate in this Beta program, please click [here](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/). The VTEX team will get in touch, and once you have joined our Beta Program, we will take care of upgrading all users in your store's account to the new experience. No additional setup is required.

To help you navigate, we have created a [new Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4) dedicated to the redesigned experience, where you will be able to access help articles for the new pages and keep track of the releases as we redesign the entire platform.
