---

We've implemented some improvements to [VTEX Sales App](/en/tutorial/vtex-sales-app-faq--3CRKQHzflSW0DXenEHUpP5), including simplifying checkout steps, optimizing customer data, and creating new purchase flows. The updates were developed to:

- Speed up the checkout process.
- Reduce friction in sales.
- Improve the user shopping experience.

By the end of April 2025, all stores using the **VTEX Sales App** will be updated to the new experience.

## What has changed?

Previously, **VTEX Sales App** offered users a single purchase flow with many steps to place the order, and you had to provide different customer information at checkout. All this created friction in sales and made the shopping experience time-consuming.

Now, the **VTEX Sales App** shopping experience has become simpler, faster, and adapted to different flows. See more information in the table below:

| **Improvement** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| <p><b>Fewer checkout steps</b></p><p>The purchase process now requires fewer screens and steps, adapting to the shipping method and available customer information. The result is a smoother sales process and a better shopping experience for users.</p> | <p>The screens and steps that were removed are:</p><p><ul><li>Postal code confirmation screen for carts with local inventory items (On Hands) or pickup.</li><li>Confirmation screen for personal/commercial information.</li><li>Address confirmation screen.</li><li>Package management page.</li><li>The 'Additional information' field on the page for entering the "Number" for the shipping address.</li><li>When the "Additional information" field is not completed, it isn't checked again.</li></ul></p><p>The required information is pulled from other steps or requested when necessary.</p> |
| <p><b>New purchase flow</b></p><p>The purchase flow is more flexible and adapted.</p> | <p>Users can:</p><p><ul><li>Choose the shipping method and the pickup point directly on the Product Details Page (PDP).</li><li>Change the shipping address on the summary page (via the modal).</li></ul></p> |
| <p><b>Update to interface information</b></p><p>The interface provides clearer and more precise information and instructions, improving communication.</p> | <p>The information updates are:</p><p><ul><li>A warning informing the user that a new address will be added and linked to the customer account. This happens when a customer identified during navigation simulates a purchase using a postal code that isn't linked to their saved address.</li><li>Location alerts and shipping costs only when necessary.</li><li>Pickup cost in the sidebar of the cart/checkout.</li><li>Standard <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/selecao-de-sellers-white-label--3MemNQ4pKkWCpMdzI27AHa">heuristic for placing orders</a> on the PDP to align with the checkout, ensuring both prioritize the most cost-effective option.</li><li>Adjustment and standardization of address format.</li><li>Address number listed in the location modal.</li><li>Price per item when more than one item is purchased.</li></ul></p> |
| <p><b>Customer data optimization</b></p><p>The system efficiently leverages previously provided customer information, streamlining the purchase process and reducing sales friction.</p> | <p>Information requests have been improved as follows:</p><p><ul><li>Fewer customer information requests.</li><li>Addresses registered in customer accounts display directly on the checkout.</li></ul></p> |

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. Stores using the **VTEX Sales App** are being automatically updated with the improvements, and they will all be updated by the end of April 2025.
