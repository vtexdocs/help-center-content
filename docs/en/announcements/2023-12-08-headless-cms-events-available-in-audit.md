[Audit](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/audit--5RXf9WJ5YLFBcS8q8KcxTA), a VTEX Admin module that records events in your store for future auditing, now processes [Headless CMS](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-pages--3DO6rBhZ1p3zndnFu5BgRt) events. Headless CMS is the VTEX solution that allows managing web content with the autonomy to create, edit, and publish content via the VTEX Admin.

## What has changed?

We added the Headless CMS events listed below to the Audit logs:

| Action | Event description | Event details |
|---|---|---|
| TRY_PUBLISHING | Attempt to publish a page. | Event ID. |
| TRY_PUBLISH_IN_RELEASE | Attempt to publish a release. | Event ID. |
| TRY_UNPUBLISHING | Attempt to unpublish a page. | Event ID. |
| RESTORE_CONTENT | Content restore. | Event ID. |
| TRY_UPDATING_DRAFT | Attempt to update a draft. | Event ID. |
| TRY_UNPUBLISHING_AND_OVERWRITING | Attempt to unpublish and overwrite a page. | Event ID. |
| done.invoke.deleteContent | Delete content. | Event ID. |
| done.invoke.deleteContentVariant | Delete content version. | Event ID. |

In the **Action** column, all Headless CMS events also display the following information:

* **CONTENT_ID:** unique identifier of the content.
* **VARIANT_ID:** unique identifier of the content version.
* **WORKSPACE**: workspace where the action occurred.
