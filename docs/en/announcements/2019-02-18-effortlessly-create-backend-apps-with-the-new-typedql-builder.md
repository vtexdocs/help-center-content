announcementSynopsisEN: 'New VTEX.IO builder reduces code duplicity in apps developed using GraphQL e TypeScript.'
---

We've launched a new builder, which makes it easier to use GraphQL and TypeScript while developing back-end apps. The code writing and maintenance processes became simpler than ever.

## How it is today
While developing apps with GraphQL and TypeScript, it's necessary to maintain two different protocol declarations in the `/node` folder:  `/graphql/schema.graphql` and ` type declarations`, using TypeScript.

That means code duplication, which makes it harder to manage and maintain the project. More than that, inconsistencies and bugs may appear more frequently.


## TypedQL Builder's main advantages
The __TypedQL Builder__ is the solution for all the problems of developing with both GraphQL and TypeScript:

- Automatic generation of `schema.graphql`
- Proper (and safe) translation from TypeScript into GraphQL
- Takes full advantage of TypeScript's resources, previously unavailable for using with GraphQL SDL
- Makes it possible to build an entire back-end app using only TypeScript


## What's the impact?
Absolutely none. Because it's an optional solution, no feature, builder, or dependency is affected by the __TypedQL Builder__.
