With an ever-increasing volume of data available for ecommerce operations to evaluate the results of their sales channels, it becomes essential to provide relevant information so that decisions can be made with greater assertiveness. This is why we created the new [Sales Performance](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sales-performance--3DMube0sEsK9vPcRYGas72) dashboard, a flexible, complete dashboard designed for unified commerce.

The dashboard allows users to analyze data from all sales channels of the store and its sellers, including metrics on revenue, orders, average ticket, and more. It also includes charts and tables so you can compare results from different periods, and introduces eleven filter options to provide unified insights into your entire operation.

## What has changed?
Previously, your VTEX Admin only had the Insights page to generate business intelligence from your operations data. We have now included the Sales Performance page, where you can have a more detailed view of the results of the different sales channels of your store. The Insights page will remain in your VTEX Admin.

## Why did we make this change?
Before we included the Sales Performance page, retailers needed access to different tools to explore the results of their operation and their sellers across all sales channels in which they were present. With the new page, the analysis of this data is centralized within your VTEX Admin, allowing you to:  

- Monitor the health of your business by displaying the results of revenue, orders, products, sellers, and channels in a single page.   
- Assess the impact of high-demand events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, on your sales.  
- Understand the reasons for variations in sales volume or order conversion rate.  
- Find opportunities to improve the results of your store and your sellers.    

## What needs to be done?
The Sales Performance page is automatically available in your VTEX Admin. To access it, go to the side menu and click on **Analytics > Sales Performance**. In some versions of the VTEX Admin, you will find this page under __Apps > Installed Apps__.
