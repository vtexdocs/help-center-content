Streamlining processes is key for digital commerce operations to keep up with the dynamic and fast-paced nature of global markets. Certain critical maintenance and authorization actions, however, must be centrally managed given the potential negative impact of mistakes. 

That is why each VTEX account has a single [Sponsor user](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-sponsor-user) – the only one who is granted full access to every section in the Admin. If you are with us for a while now, you might have thought: 

_"A Sponsor what?! Don't you mean the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Master user</span>"?_

Rest assured, we made no mistake. After careful consideration, our team decided to change the name of this important role to remove unintended and unnecessary references to slavery and replace them with more appropriate terms.

## Sponsor management now invitation-based and fully auditable

But that's not all. We also completely revamped the process to change the Sponsor user for an account, transforming it into an invitation-based transfer flow that is fully auditable.

Check out [Transferring store ownership](/en/tutorial/transferring-store-ownership) for more details on this new process.

## Authentication credentials no longer restricted to Sponsor user

Before, only the Sponsor user could create and manage appKey and appToken pairs for [API integration authentication](/en/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet). Now, as announced in [Improvements in Application Key management](/announcements/improvements-in-application-key-management--6DsPdiQ65RKNUNl7p93zHJ), the Sponsor user can delegate the responsibility of creating authentication credentials as needed, giving more flexibility to store owners.
