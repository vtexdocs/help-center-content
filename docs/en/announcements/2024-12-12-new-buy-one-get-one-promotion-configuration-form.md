VTEX has made available a new [form](/en/tutorial/compre-e-ganhe--tutorials_322) for configuring the Buy One Get Onepromotion. This feature offers a new interface, making it easier to create promotions that offer customers benefits such as free shipping or gifts when they add products to the cart.

## Why did we make this change?
We've created the new form to improve the experience of configuring promotions in the VTEX Admin. The main benefits include:

- Creating promotions more quickly and conveniently, saving time with a simplified interface.
- Reducing configuration errors through well-defined steps and an intuitive visualization of promotion criteria.
- Customizing promotions easily, adjusting the purchase conditions and benefits offered to customers.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. The new promotion form is already available in all VTEX stores.
