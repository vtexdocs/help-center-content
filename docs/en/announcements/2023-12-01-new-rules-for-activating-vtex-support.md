---

Now, for Brazil accounts to contact VTEX Support, the  **Open Support Ticket** resource of the **VTEX - Support** product must be enabled in their role. A user with the *User Administrator - Restricted* role must configure this permission in [License Manager](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3).

>ℹ️ Admin users with the ** Owner (Admin Super) ** role are automatically associated with the * Open Support Ticket* resource. 

## What has changed?

The configuration is only valid for Brazil accounts and restricts the ability to open support tickets to users with permission. To open a request to the support team, the user must have the **Open Support Ticket** resource of the **VTEX - Support** product in their [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc).

## Why did we make this change?

In terms of best security practices, this step aims to enhance the protection of the store's sensitive information.

## What needs to be done?

A user with the *User Administrator - Restricted* role needs to assign the **Open Support Ticket** resource of the **VTEX - Support** product in [License Manager](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to the [roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) of the users that should have permission to open support tickets.
