As of November 20, the promotion of type __Maximum Price per Item__ will no longer exist. But if your store uses this kind of promotion, don't panic - the same effect may be achieved through other methods, which in addition bring advantages.

Actually, we are making this change precisely because, with the development of the platform, this type of promotion has become possible through other methods.

By eliminating the Maximum Price per Item promotion, we are improving the performance of the promotions module as well as the store management.

>⚠️ Until November 20, the Maximum Price per Item promotion continues to exist. However, the maximum number of items allowed becomes **100**. Previously the maximum allowed was 500.

>❗ If you use any Maximum Price per Item promotion, read this announcement through the end and adapt the method in your store. Otherwise, the SKUs concerned will no longer be impacted by this business strategy.

## Alternatives

There are two possible ways to achieve the same effect of the Maximum Price per Item promotion:

### Regular Promotion

You can set up a [Regular Promotion](/en/tutorial/regular-promotion) with the __Maximum Price per Item__ discount.

This is a better scenario than the previous one, since retailers have more options for grouping, for example, by product category.

### Fixed price

For stores that have already migrated to the [new pricing module](/en/tutorial/prices-v2), it's also possible to set a fixed price for the SKU. In this case, you are not creating a promotion, but making an actual change to the price of the product.
