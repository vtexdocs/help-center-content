---

Customer Credit is an app that provides credit for trusted e-commerce customers. This amount can be used as a payment method to buy items from the store - transformed into invoices in the system.

In April 2020 VTEX launched two new features for Customer Credit:

- Invoices bulk update;
- Accounts bulk import and update.

The new features allow retailers to update the app information in a more agile way, optimizing their e-commerce processes.

## What changes

Before that, retailers had to manually create an account for each customer that would be included in the credit system. They also needed to manage the invoice information, one by one.

Both operations are now automated by the data import system in the Admin.

## How does it work

In both cases, the information is entered into the system using a CSV file.

VTEX has a CSV file template to facilitate the process. Retailers must download this template from the Admin and fill it in without changing its structure.

In the case of invoices, just update the information in the columns. When creating new accounts, retailers must enter all the data required to add new customers to their bases.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that the two new features do not exclude the possibility of making the changes manually. The information update can be done via Admin, spreadsheet or API.

To learn how to use the two new features, [check out our Customer Credit track](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/customer-credit-como-comecar--1hCRg21lXYy2seOKgqQ2CC/36grlQ69NK6OCuioeekyCs "check out our Customer Credit track"), in which you will find the step by step for both processes.
