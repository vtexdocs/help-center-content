With Pricing V1 deprecation, see what you need to do to migrate your store to the most updated version of the Prices module.

The discontinuation will only affect stores that still have the Pricing V1 module. For stores that are already using the Prices module, nothing will change.

Pricing V1 is an outdated version of the Prices module. If your store is still using Pricing V1, it is not using all the features and potential that VTEX offers for price management, and may have lower performance.

## How do I know if my account is using Pricing V1 or the updated version?

To find out if your account is still using Pricing V1, follow the steps below:

1. In your VTEX Admin, access the __Products__ module.
2. Click on the __Prices__ tab.
3. Check the __Price List__.

If you see a screen similar to the one below, it means that your account needs to migrate.

If your VTEX account still uses previous versions of the VTEX Admin (such as "vtexcommercestable"), it will also need to migrate. To do so, please follow the steps below:

  1. In the top bar, click on __Catalog__.
  2. Then click on the __Pricing__ module.
  3. You will be redirected to the current price management Admin.

## Why will Pricing V1 be deactivated?

Pricing V1 does not have some of the features that are available to customers in the Prices module. Moreover, its architecture does not allow for upgrades due to certain technical limitations in infrastructure.

We will disable Pricing V1 to prevent negative impacts on other modules, and for VTEX clients to have a better experience when managing their business.

## What are the advantages of migrating?

The migration will transfer price management to [our updated Prices module](https://merch.myvtex.com/admin/pricing). Along with this process, new features will be available. In addition, the performance of the module will be optimized and you will receive more efficient support.

**New features**:

- Price for minimum quantity.
- Cost price and markup.
- Price rules by price tables.
- Price rounding rules.
- Price variation limit.

## What's the impact on my store?

Pricing V1 will be deactivated. It means that it will not receive maintenance as of 09/30/2020, and will not undergo any upgrades. In addition, it will no longer be possible to request data on active operations, and we will no longer provide  support in case of problems or failures in the module, which may affect your storeâ€™s operation.

All customers currently using Pricing V1 must migrate. The process will not impact or interfere with the store's operation, and VTEX will provide assistance to ensure that it happens in the best possible way.

## What do I need to do to migrate?

Stores using **Pricing V1 to set the pricing by UTM** should contact their Account Manager, Customer Success Manager, or the VTEX Support to migrate to the Prices module with the assistance of the VTEX support team by 09/30/2020.

Stores using Pricing V1 only for **price management, without using UTM**, will be automatically migrated by VTEX, requiring no action from the customer. In this scenario, all information contained in Pricing V1 will be updated in the Prices module safely and gradually, and no data will be lost.

## Do I need to update my APIs?

For better store performance and stability, VTEX recommends that customers review and update their APIs, always staying updated with the latest versions.

However, for the Pricing V1 migration, this change is optional. You can find the updated API routes in [our documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/pricing-api-overview). 

Learn more about the new features of the Price module's updated version by accessing [our Prices Track](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/prices-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP). 

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager or Customer Success Manager, or open a ticket in [our Support center](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/signin?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.vtex.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Frequests).
