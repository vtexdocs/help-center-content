We have developed new features for [Sales App](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-instore/p) with the goal of improving customers' shopping experience in physical stores. The improvements provide greater flexibility and dynamism in displaying your products, making the purchasing process easier and faster.

## What has changed?

Aiming to improve customers' shopping experience in physical stores, we have introduced new features for Sales App. Check out the main improvements:

* **HTML in product description:** Now product descriptions can contain HTML, which provides a more flexible and dynamic way to present information.
* **Local stock sale:** Allows sellers to complete a purchase using Sales App, without having to go through the checkout process. Furthermore, Sales App allows sellers to group in a single transaction products for delivery with others that can be picked up immediately. Learn more in [Enabling Local stock sale in VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/enabling-on-hands-in-vtex-sales-app--54eQN4rOH5yBYPGG2w8v9q).
* **Similar product suggestions:** Displays similar products on the product page, offering a wider variety of products and diversifying the range of available options.
* **Other offers**: Displays the best price available on the product page, including prices from both the online store and other physical stores.

## What needs to be done?

The **HTML features in the product description** and **Other offers** will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores that use Sales App.

To implement **Similar product suggestions**, follow the steps in the article [Configuring similar products, suggestions, accessories, and generics](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-produto-similar-sugestoes-acessorios-e-genericos--tutorials_280).
