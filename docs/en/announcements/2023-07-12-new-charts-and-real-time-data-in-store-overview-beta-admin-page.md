The [Overview (beta)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/visao-geral-da-loja-beta--7i8wNsQQgbbFhYMYbQ5X46) page in your VTEX Admin has been redesigned and now offers new charts, metrics, and views. These new features allow you to monitor your operation in real time, providing insights on metrics for you and your team to get quick feedback on the actions taken in the store and act promptly on improvements.

## What has changed?

We have improved the interface and data updates to optimize your analysis. The changes include:

- **Real-time data:** The charts in the Monitoring section update automatically within three minutes, depending on the view. Other page sections are updated every 15 minutes.  
- **Improved charts:** Now the _Revenue captured_, _Orders captured_, and _New sessions_ charts are highlighted, displaying both growth or decrease percentages, in addition to the absolute value. These new charts have replaced the old _Order trend analysis_ and _Highest grossing categories_ charts. The _Sales funnel_ is now within the _Conversion rate_ metric, and you can access it by clicking the arrow icon <i class='fa fa-chevron-down'></i>.  
- **Metric changes:** We have removed the _Popular products without stock_ and _Orders with payment in authorization_ metrics to focus on revenue and order metrics. Besides, we have included the new _Orders canceled_ metric, which can be viewed in the _Orders captured_ chart, as we believe this metric better indicates the health of an operation.  
- **New views:** Toggle between the `Accumulated` and `Last 2 hours` views to tailor the view to your needs. The _Accumulated_ option is ideal for tracking the overall performance of actions in the store, while the _Last 2 hours_ option allows you to identify any unexpected behavior.    

## Why did we make this change?

We have made changes to the Overview (Beta) page to provide more clarity to your operation, ensuring that the store is performing as expected.

Real-time data supports your team in analyzing campaign results and identifying potential negative impacts from configuration changes or deploys. The highlighted metrics indicate whether there has been an impact on the number of orders, sessions, or customer conversion, affecting the health and performance of your business.  

## What needs to be done?

The updated version of the [Store Overview (Beta)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/visao-geral-da-loja-beta--7i8wNsQQgbbFhYMYbQ5X46) page will be available in the VTEX Admin as of August 17th. To access the page, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Dashboards > Overview (Beta)**, or type _Overview (Beta)_ in the search bar at the top of the page.

The page will be available for free during its beta phase or as determined by VTEX, but note that extra fees may apply in the future.

The current Overview page in the VTEX Admin will remain available for use and can be accessed from the[ Dashboards](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/dashboards-overview--1yn2nZUoXtDO3teTEJsCNl) menu in your Admin.
