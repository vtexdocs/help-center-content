---

To enhance payment operations on the platform, VTEX is implementing the `X-VTEX-signature` authentication token. Payment providers and partners must use this token to report the status of asynchronous payment transactions via a [callback URL](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/payment-provider-protocol--RdsT2spdq80MMwwOeEq0m#callback-url).  

As of May 27, 2024,  the VTEX gateway will automatically include the callback URL information and the respective authentication token with each payment transaction.

Example of a callback URL containing the authentication token:

`https://gatewayqa.vtexpayments.com.br/api/pvt/payment-provider/transactions/8FB0F111111122222333344449984ACB/payments/A2A9A25B11111111222222333327883C/callback?accountName=teampaymentsintegrations&X-VTEX-signature=R123456789aBcDeFGHij1234567890tk`

## What needs to be done?

Starting June 26, 2024, all payment providers and partners must report the status of asynchronous payment transactions exclusively via the callback URL and authentication token.

After this date, any transaction status updates sent only via callback URL (without the authentication token) will be blocked, and the respective payment transactions will be canceled.

For more information about the callback URL, see [Payment Provider Protocol](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/payment-provider-protocol--RdsT2spdq80MMwwOeEq0m#callback-url) and [Create Payment endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/payment-provider-protocol#post-/payments).
