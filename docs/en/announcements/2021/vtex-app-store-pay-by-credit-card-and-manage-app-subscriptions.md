By accessing the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/), VTEX customers can find extensions and integrations with partners and install apps in their stores with one click. These applications can be either free or paid.

To improve the experience of the billing process for apps, we have implemented two new features: credit card payment for app purchases in Brazil and subscription management directly in the VTEX App Store.

## What has changed?
Previously, VTEX IO app purchases in Brazil could only be made with “boleto” (popular Brazilian offline payment method); it was not possible to view the date and amount of future charges on the Your Account page, and unsubscribing to apps was restricted to the Admin panel. 

Now you can choose to pay for app subscriptions with “boleto” or credit card. The [Your Account](https://apps.vtex.com/account) page now allows you to manage your subscriptions associated with apps from the VTEX App Store and check upcoming payments, all in one place.

## Why did we make this change?
With these changes, we aim to provide flexibility in choosing your payment method and easy management of your paid app subscriptions.

## What needs to be done?
No action is needed. When you purchase an app in Brazil, the option to pay by credit card will be available at checkout.
To manage your subscriptions, access the [Subscriptions](https://apps.vtex.com/account#/subscriptions) section in your VTEX App Store account.
