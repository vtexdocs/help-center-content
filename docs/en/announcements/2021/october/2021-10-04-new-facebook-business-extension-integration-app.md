---

Facebook allows you to list your products and to have a strategic presence on social networks like Facebook and Instagram, increasing the visibility of your brand. A new platform that integrates services and new features for businesses, called Facebook Business Extension (FBE), was recently launched.

VTEX developed the _Facebook Business Extension and Conversions API_ app to make the integration of VTEX stores with FBE a simple process. The integration automatically installs some of Facebook's key features, such as the [Conversions API](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook-business-extension--2hS3ANSZ7vlHCcba4h7k8D#conversions-api) and the [Facebook Pixel](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook-business-extension--2hS3ANSZ7vlHCcba4h7k8D#facebook-pixel).

The _Facebook Business Extension and Conversions API_ app is available globally, for all stores that want to integrate with FBE.

## What has changed?

VTEX had a native [Facebook integration](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook--7h8KvIC4DbRRc8VlyJ8PFc) solution, which allowed you to integrate your catalog and make your products available for Facebook services and features.

The new integration with Facebook Business Extension has the same capacity, besides offering new features and services, in a simpler and more complete way.

By integrating your store with the_ Facebook Business Extension and Conversions API_ app, a single interface in your VTEX Admin will have all the commands for managing Facebook assets.

In addition, the integration with the _Facebook Business Extension and Conversions API_ app automatically configures the following features:

- [Conversions API](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook-business-extension--2hS3ANSZ7vlHCcba4h7k8D#conversions-api)
- [Facebook Pixel](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook-business-extension--2hS3ANSZ7vlHCcba4h7k8D#facebook-pixel)
- [Catalog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/catalog)
- Facebook Call-to-action button
- Instagram Call-to-action button
- Creation of a Facebook Business Manager account

The Facebook Business Extension e Conversions API app is fully compatible with stores operating with VTEX IO, and partially compatible with stores that are CMS or [Headless](https://vtex.com/en/blog/strategy/headless-commerce-what-it-is-and-why-its-growing-so-fast/). To identify which model your store operates with, go to [Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app). In the table below, you can see the features available for each case:

| **VTEX IO** | **CMS or Headless** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Facebook Pixel | --- |
| Conversions API | Conversions API (purchase only) |
| Catalog | Catalog |
| Facebook and Instagram Call-to-action buttons | Facebook and Instagram Call-to-action buttons |

## Why did we make this change?

In addition to having access to new FBE services and features, the new integration will allow you to manage Facebook services and features in a simpler way, centralized in your VTEX Admin.

The features installed automatically with the app integration also offer several benefits to your business, such as:

- Reduced cost per action as a result of the improved connection.
- Ad optimization for actions that happen at the end of the customer journey.
- Improved measurement of marketing data.
- Increased data control.

## What needs to be done?

To integrate your VTEX store with FBE, just follow the steps in the [Facebook Business Extension integration guide](/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook-business-extension--2hS3ANSZ7vlHCcba4h7k8D).

> ⚠️ Even if you have already configured the <a href= "/en/tracks/integracao-com-o-facebook--7h8KvIC4DbRRc8VlyJ8PFc">Facebook Integration</a>, we recommend you to integrate your store with the *Facebook Business Extension and Conversions API* app. This will give you access to improved services and new features.

It is worth noting that the two integrations do not interfere with each other. Once the integration with the _Facebook Business Extension and Conversions API_ app is complete, your store will have access to all the services provided by Facebook Business Extension.
