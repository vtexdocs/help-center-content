You can use order reports to analyze the performance of promotions or as packing slips, to facilitate store logistics.

All VTEX stores can now export a larger volume of data, as the limit was increased to accommodate __up to 50,000 orders__ per report.

## What has changed?

Previously, the limit was 7,000 orders, so you had to export multiple reports for a more significant number of orders. In July 2020, we expanded the limit to 20,000, and now we have increased that number to __50,000 orders__.

## Why did we make this change?

We have increased the limit of orders that can be exported to better serve retailers who need to generate reports with a high number of orders. It also facilitates their store management.

## What needs to be done?

No action is needed. The change will be automatically implemented in all VTEX stores.
