inStore, VTEX’s solution for brick-and-mortar stores, allows our clients to customize their stores according to their business needs. They can make these changes through fields embedded in the purchase flow.

One of these fields is the [sales rep code](/en/tracks/instore-personalizaciones--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/5kNtS80hbBGg58jMeF8CRv), customization in which the sales rep associates a personal code to each sale they make.

Now the client can opt to make the sales rep code a required field. In this case, a sale can only be made if a sales rep code is entered in the `Vendor` field.

## Benefits

In physical stores, it is common to pay commissions to the sales reps that make the highest number of sales or reach a certain sales target.

Consequentially, having a precise list of the sales made by each sales rep facilitates the commissions’ management. 

## How it works

VTEX clients can enable inStore customizations via Admin, by embedding JavaScript codes in a template available on the platform. 

For more information on how to add this and other customizations regarding the sales rep code to your store, read our [inStore customization track](/en/tracks/instore-customizacoes--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/4mwdBrFsmE2EPE0FzgX28b).
