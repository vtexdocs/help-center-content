To help you provide tailor-made ecommerce experiences for your business and rethink the way you collaborate with customers, suppliers, and channel partners, we are in the process of publishing a new set of articles and tutorials on [B2B digital commerce](https://vtex.com/us-en/b2b-commerce/):

- [B2B overview](/en/tutorial/b2b-overview--5vb9SNXhX2bZnkpAh7ADdC)
- [Practical guide on how to set up a self-service B2B store](/en/tutorial/configuring-b2b-self-service-stores--4576nMaRKk4madDZ7liiXS)
- [Practical guide on how to facilitate the operation of B2B stores](/en/tutorial/facilitating-b2b-store-operation--8t1f9FYBsSCopHHVujKWR)

This documentation presents the main resources available on the platform for different B2B ecommerce scenarios.

> ℹ️ This is just the beginning! In the coming months, we will gather all B2B documentation in a [specific section](/en/category/b2b--3BQkex089ohYNodLZKKrhi) in the VTEX Help Center.
