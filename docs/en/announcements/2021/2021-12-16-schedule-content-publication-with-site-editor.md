The Site Editor feature **Configurations** was updated. It is now called **Versions** and allows you to create deactivated versions of your store’s content and activate them whenever you want.

![activating-versions-en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2021/2021-12-16-schedule-content-publication-with-site-editor_1.gif)

## What has changed?
Previously, the **Versions** feature was called **Configurations**, and it only allowed users to create a new activated version, such as a Carousel with promotional products or schedule to activate it. After inactivating a version, it was also not possible to activate it again.

Now, you can create an inactive version and activate it when you desire. Besides, it is also possible to activate old versions of a content.

 ## Why did we make this change?
To make it easier to publish content using Site Editor, we have improved the experience of creating store block versions.

## What needs to be done?
The **Versions** feature is now active in Site Editor and you can already use it.
