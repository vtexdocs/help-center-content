---

inStore is one of VTEX's main products for unified commerce operations. It’s an app that allows your store to provide a true omnichannel experience, integrating your online and physical channels and placing your customers at the core of the business.

Sales associates in your physical store can now share carts with customers via QR codes, using the Social Selling feature in inStore. A QR code is a stylized barcode that can be scanned by smartphones using the camera or dedicated apps.

The new feature allows store customers to use their own mobile phones or tablets to scan the QR code generated on the device used in the store. Then, they can access a link to a shopping cart with products and complete the purchase.

## What has changed?

Previously, the Social Selling feature in inStore consisted of generating a link that sales associates could share with customers via WhatsApp or other social networks.

With the change, inStore now also generates a QR code that can be scanned by customers' devices, in addition to the shareable link.

## Why did we make this change?

This update aims to expand the Social Selling strategy using inStore, making the process easier for physical store sales associates and customers. Thus, we offer more autonomy to sales associates and simplify access to the shared cart.

The QR codes allows customers to use inStore to place orders in stores that do not yet have an integrated local payment method.

## What needs to be done?

For stores that already use Social Selling in inStore, the update is automatic.

If you would like to use inStore Social Selling, you need to[ contact the VTEX support team](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) and request the installation.
