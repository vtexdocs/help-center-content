---

VTEX recently started offering an integration with [iDEAL](https://www.ideal.nl/en/consumers/what-is-ideal/), one of the leading payment methods in The Netherlands. Used in over 60% of the transactions in the country, iDEAL can be configured in your store through an integration with [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/).

Adyen is currently the only gateway affiliation that processes payments made via iDEAL. Clients interested in this integration who already have Adyen will be able to offer this new payment method to their customers.

## What has changed?

With this new feature, Adyen is offering yet another payment method to expand its reach and target the Dutch market.

In practice, when a consumer makes a purchase and pays with iDEAL, they enter a simple and intuitive payment flow in which their purchase and data are confirmed in just a few steps.

## What needs to be done?

To use iDEAL as a payment method, you need to configure it in VTEXâ€™s Admin. Check out the complete step-by-step documentation[ Configuring iDEAL payment method in Adyen integration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-o-metodo-de-pagamento-ideal-na-integracao-com-a-adyen--6EY1uvOVcomIFgMv81FAub).
