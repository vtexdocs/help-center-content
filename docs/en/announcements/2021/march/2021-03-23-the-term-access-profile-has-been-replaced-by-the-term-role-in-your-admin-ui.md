## What has changed?

What was called “Access Profile” in the Account Management module will now be called “Role”. This change applies only to the English interface. The Admin and all documentation have been updated with the new term. No functionality has been affected. Here’s an example of how the term appears on the Roles dashboard in the Admin:

![Roles Panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2021/march/2021-03-23-the-term-access-profile-has-been-replaced-by-the-term-role-in-your-admin-ui_1.png)

All documents that mentioned this concept, both on our Developer Portal and Help Center, have been changed to include the new term.

## Why did we make this change?

This change was made because we believe the term “Role” is more appropriate for the concept it represents.
