---

If a potential customer visiting your store adds products to the cart and identifies themself with their email, this is a strong indication of purchase intent. Therefore, the interruption of this purchase flow should be handled as a lost opportunity.

To recover this sale, it is common for ecommerce operations to automate the sending of emails to the customer, presenting the abandoned cart and the option to complete the purchase with one click.

 With the new[ Abandoned Cart](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexlatam-abandoned-cart-service/p) app, configuring this type of email is now easier and faster.

## What has changed?
Previously, a number of configurations were required in several modules, such as Master Data, CMS, and Message Center.

Now, after installing the app, all you have to do is configure the sending and determine the email template in the Message Center. As a result, customers who do not complete their purchases will automatically receive abandoned cart reminders.

## Why did we make this change?
The app allows you to quickly and easily configure the sending of emails that help recover sales and increase the conversion rate.

## What needs to be done?
Install the app from the[ VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexlatam-abandoned-cart-service/p) and follow the instructions in this[documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-abandoned-cart-service) to configure the sending of reminders using the[Abandoned Cart](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexlatam-abandoned-cart-service/p) app.
