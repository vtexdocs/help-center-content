announcementSynopsisEN: 'Have more flexibility with the new automatic invoicing field in the promissory settings.'
---

Often used to enable cash payment, a promissory is a “promise to pay” that requires manual approval from the retailer for the transaction to be completed.

On VTEX, among several payment options available, you can also offer payment with [promissory](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/pagamentos--6GAS7ZzGAm7AGoEAwDbwJG/1wWt35dRwEboRs1nrSx7G0#promissory-notes).

## What has changed?

Currently, by default, promissories are invoiced automatically upon payment authorization, which may not meet specific business needs.

For some clients, it may be important to authorize changes to orders. In this case, you must fill in the Change margin range field when configuring a promissory. 

If the value in the Change margin range field is greater than zero, invoicing will occur 30 days after authorization.

Now, with the new Automatic invoicing field, you can customize the number of days — between 1 and 30 — for a promissory to be invoiced by the system.

## Why did we make this change? 

We understand that each business has different strategies and needs, so adding the Automatic invoicing field will give you more flexibility and control over your receivables, by allowing you to define the number of days for invoicing.

## What needs to be done?

By default, the new field value will be set to 15 days. If you want to change it, check out our documentation on [Setting up payments with Promissory](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-pagamentos-com-promissoria--5pW7avTwtyQcMu4uiW8quQ?&utm_source=autocomplete).
