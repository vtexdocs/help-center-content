The [Received SKUs](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/approving-suggestions-for-skus/) page allows marketplaces to view, prioritize and catalog items sent by sellers, making these products available for sale. Through the page, it is possible to catalog SKUs received from sellers, rejecting them, creating new products, or associating them with existing products.  

The Received SKUs page features a list of all SKUs sent by sellers to the marketplace. Now, clicking on an item of the list will open a sidebar containing the main information about that SKU.

## What has changed?
Previously, to check a received SKU's information, you had to leave the main list and access its details page. Now, by clicking on any SKU in the list, you will view a summary of that SKU's main information within a sidebar.  

The sidebar contains the SKU's images, price, inventory levels, and product attributes such as a description, specifications, codes and IDs. It also includes the matching percentage that the SKU received from the [matcher](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/entendendo-a-pontuacao-do-vtex-matcher?locale=pt) set up in your store. You can still access the SKU’s full details by clicking on the button *View details page*.

## Why did we make this change?
We developed the sidebar to provide more agility to your operation and facilitate the cataloging of received SKUs, by allowing you to:  
- Access SKUs’ key information, without leaving the main list.   
- Quickly evaluate and validate the attributes of each SKU.  
- Bulk catalog SKUs in less time.  

## What needs to be done?
No updates are required, as we have automatically included the sidebar in your VTEX Admin. 

To access the new feature, go to Sellers > Received SKUs and click on any item in the list. Learn more in our article about [cataloging Received SKUs](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/approving-suggestions-for-skus/).
