Subscription promotions are a practical and intuitive way to attract customers and build customer loyalty with the advantages of recurring subscription and discounts for specific profiles.

This feature allows you to create subscription promotions with frequency intervals that can be days, weeks, months, or years.

## What has changed?
Before, when [creating a subscription promotion](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-a-subscription-promotion--3ROT13HYNeUIv0plDqgNed), clients could choose between **weekly**, **monthly**, or **annual** frequency options.
With the new feature, you can choose between **days**, **weeks**, **months**, or **years** and set a numeric value for the interval.

## Why did we make this change?
We improved the configuration of subscription promotions by making their creation easier and more accurate with more specific frequency intervals.

## What needs to be done?
No action is needed. The change will be implemented automatically in all VTEX stores.
Promotions created previously will continue to work with the original configuration.
