announcementSynopsisEN: 'The Admin has a new language option'
---

The Admin currently supports different language options. This enhances the overall product experience, not only through translations but also on a cultural level, taking into account the particularities of each country.

## What has changed?

As of February 2021, VTEX users will find a sixth language option in Admin. In addition to Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian and Romanian, the platform is now also in Japanese.

## Why did we make this change?
The Admin’s translation into Japanese was driven by the [opening of our new office in Singapore](https://vtex.com/us-en/press/vtex-opens-office-in-singapore-to-better-serve-its-global-customers-in-the-apac-region/), to better serve our global customers in the Asia-Pacific region.  

## What do you need to do
To view the Admin in Japanese, select JP in the language dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen.
