When using [Subscriptions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-subscriptions-work--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453) — the app developed by VTEX to facilitate recurring sales — merchants might need to configure a manual price for each item to provide better deals to recurrent shoppers. 

With this in mind, now you can enable the Manual Price feature for Subscriptions v3 in your store, which allows you to:

* Apply a manual price on each subscription item instead of the current price applied.
* Maintain the same manual price for every future recurrent order from that subscription, if desired.

## What has changed?

Previously, the Manual Price feature was not available for subscription orders. It was only available for regular orders at Checkout. Now, we have extended the feature to cover Subscriptions v3 as well.

## Why did we make this change?

This change is motivated by merchants’ demands to set manual prices for each item in a subscription order. Considering that product prices can change over time, maintaining the same commercial rules for future subscription orders can be a good strategy to offer competitive prices and retain customers over a longer period.

## What needs to be done?

To enable the Manual Price feature for Subscriptions, make sure you follow the steps described in the developer guide [Enabling Manual Price for Subscriptions v3](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/enabling-manual-prices-for-subscriptions-v3).

>⚠️ Manual Price is only available for Subscriptions v3. If you are using a previous version of the Subscriptions system, check out the [Subscriptions v3 migration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/subscriptions-v3-migration-guide).
