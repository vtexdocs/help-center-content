Keep track of your store's performance right on your admin. With __Insights Web__, the desktop version of the app you already know, it's easier than ever to identify opportunities and check results.

__Insights Web__ is a product of the findings of dozens of interviews with our clients. We addressed their needs to develop features focused on metrics and performance evaluation. 

One of those new features is the __Target Tracker__. It allows you to define a goal and a deadline for your store. The data provided will be used to show in real time how well (or not) you store is doing.

Start exploring __Insights Web__ right now. In your admin's sidebar, click on __Insights__ (in the _Analytics_ section).
