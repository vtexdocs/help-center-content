## What changed?

Before VTEX Pick and Pack, merchants didn't have an exclusive platform connected to VTEX Admin to manage order fulfillment. The processes of order picking and packaging typically involved multiple manual actions by the merchant, which were inefficient and led to errors, failure to meet customer promises, and higher logistics costs.

However, in its initial version, VTEX Pick and Pack didn't cover all the needs within the vast diversity of businesses and operations that exist today. We added new functionalities to make the product more flexible, scalable, and suitable for a wider range of architectures.

Below is a comparison between the versions of VTEX Pick and Pack:

| Monopicking: the product picking process followed the dynamics of one order per picker, per picking route, individually.                                                                                            | Multipicking: the picking process caters to scenarios where more than one order needs to be assigned per picker and/or orders need to be separated according to the personnel's work area. It is now possible to apply multiple separation processes: Batch picking: separating products in batches to fulfill orders with the same SKU from a large inventory. Wave picking: separating a single SKU per shift, aiming to avoid an excess of products in order fulfillment. |
