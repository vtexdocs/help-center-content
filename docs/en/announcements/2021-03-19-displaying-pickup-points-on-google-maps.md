One of the most common features of websites and online stores is a map showing the location of physical stores. The new[ Store Locator](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-store-locator/p#overview) app allows stores developed with VTEX IO to list their pickup points on Google Maps and show them as markers on a map.

## What changed?

You can now install the Store Locator app in stores developed with VTEX IO and display pickup points on Google Maps using markers.

The app creates a new route that lists retail stores previously added as pickup points in your Admin's_ Inventory & shipping_ module. You can also access the new route using the `/stores` path in your store's URL. By default, this page will follow the theme that is customized in your store.

In addition, the app updates your XML file with your store’s sitemap, making pickup points available through search engines.

## Why did we make this change?
By displaying pickup points on the map, we help customers visually recognize the store’s location. This feature facilitates the process of choosing the best store for pickup.

## What you need to do
Install the app from the[ VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-store-locator/p#overview) and follow the instructions in[ this documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-locator) to set it up. Remember that, previously, you must add the pickup locations in your store.
