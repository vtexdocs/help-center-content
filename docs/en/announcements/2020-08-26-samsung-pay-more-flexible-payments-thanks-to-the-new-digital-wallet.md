VTEX always aims to provide the best shopping experience for your customers and now provides you with [Samsung Pay](https://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/ "Samsung Pay") - the Samsung [ewallet](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-carteira-digital-e-wallet?locale=es "e-wallet") - as a payment method in your e-commerce.

## Advantages
Offering digital wallets as a payment method within SmartCheckout expands the range of means of payment for your e-commerce.

This strategy allows your store to cover different buyer profiles. The more payment options, the bigger the chances that your customers will choose one and complete the purchase.

In addition, including Samsung Pay as a payment option empowers a niche of customers who only pay online using digital wallets.

## How it works
Only Samsung Pay users will be able to make purchases using this payment method, meaning end users who have already installed and configured Samsung Pay on their mobile device.

By accessing SmartCheckout and selecting Samsung Pay as payment method, customers simply need to authorize the purchase via biometric identification or app password.
