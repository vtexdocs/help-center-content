---

A [marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#being-a-vtex-marketplace) is responsible for receiving offers from its sellers and reviewing and approving them so they can be added to the catalog, which is done through the Received SKUs page in the VTEX Admin. 

To give marketplaces more control over the approval criteria for an offer, we created the **[Offer Quality Filters](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/filtros-de-qualidade-dos-anuncios--4xm0gi8leCyxHj8YdgHSJH)** configuration, in which marketplaces create the mandatory and optional requirements for their approval. 

Thus, the SKUs that are sent to the marketplace meet the requirements relevant to catalog curation.

## What has changed?

We have created a new configuration page within the Received SKUs module, called **Offer Quality Filters**, where marketplaces add and manage the requirement groups applied to the Received SKUs cataloging process. It allows you to: 

* Create requirements to filter offers submitted on the Received SKUs page.
* Define to which sellers, categories, or brands the rules will apply and exception cases.
* View which offers have been rejected for not meeting the mandatory and/or optional requirements, moving them to the "Pending," "Review," and "Rejected" tabs based on the requirements met.
* Bring more transparency to the cataloging criteria for submitted offers and how sellers and offers do or do not comply.

## Why did we make this change?

The configuration page provides many tools for operating the marketplace, including the following advantages:

* Scales up the seller and product onboarding, boosting time-to-revenue in the marketplace channel. 
* Refines the criteria used for the rejection and approval process of offers.
* Enables the marketplace catalog team to review each offer individually to see why it did not meet the requirements.
* Allows you to identify which sellers and offer types do not meet the requirements, speeding up corrections.

## What needs to be done?

The configuration page is now automatically available for all VTEX accounts using the [Received SKUs](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sugerindo-e-aprovando-skus--tutorials_396) page. No action is required to get the feature.

To access the page where you configure your offer quality filters, in the VTEX Admin, go to _Marketplace > Received SKUs > **[Offer Quality](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/filtros-de-qualidade-dos-anuncios--4xm0gi8leCyxHj8YdgHSJH)**_.
