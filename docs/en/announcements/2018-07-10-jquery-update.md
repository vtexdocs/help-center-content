We've uploaded in __beta__ a jQuery update that will fix performance issues. The full release will be completed in stable to all stores by __July 30th__. _This is not a full upgrade. Just a few pacthes of the current version will be modified._


## What's the impact?
This update affects only your store's front-end. That's why it's so important to test every page on your website. This will ensure the update won't break any features developed by your own tech team, agencies or VTEX partners.


## What you need to do
__Test your store in beta (using the URL `http://{accountName}.vtexcommercebeta.com.br`) or tell those responsible for doing so (developers and agencies, for example).__ It's essential to check every flow (all the way from the homepage and other pages to the checkout) to make sure everything is in order. This process is fast, and possible corrections are simple to implement.
