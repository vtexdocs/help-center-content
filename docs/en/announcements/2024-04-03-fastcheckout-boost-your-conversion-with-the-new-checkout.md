## What has changed?

Previously, VTEX Checkout provided an outdated experience for clients and did not follow market innovation standards. Besides, all customization required CSS and Javascript code.

Now, to provide a more dynamic client experience, we have significantly improved the following aspects of VTEX Checkout:

- Experience optimized for conversion, based on research on the best user experiences according to the[ Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/).
- Support for high-end omnichannel options.
- High performance, even in carts with multiple items.
- Customizable layout and features.
- Optimization for mobile and desktop devices.
- Continuous updates to offer the best experience by examining new features.
- Option to place an order without registering.
- Option to accept multiple coupons by default.

### Easy customization

FastCheckout allows you to create a customizable checkout experience, adapting to the contexts and needs of your store. In FastCheckout, you can customize the following features via Admin, without any coding:

- Add the store logo to the checkout.
- Customize the checkout button and menu colors.
- Set limits for order quantities and cart total amount.
- Hide or add the **promo code**, **estimated shipping**, and **SKU price display** elements.
- Configure Adobe Analytics and Google Maps API.
- Add a text description you want to display to the customer.
- Deactivate and activate tax information within the **order summary**.

We allow you to add fully custom elements, without having to be familiar with JavaScript or CSS.

>⚠️ The first version released of FastCheckout allows limited customization. Soon, you will be able to fully customize the content using the FastStore Platform extensions.

### New purchase flow

The new purchase flow in FastCheckout is designed to be dynamic and intuitive, providing your customers with a more fluid and streamlined buying experience. We've made the checkout process more efficient with clear steps and intuitive navigation.

## Why did we make this change?

The redesigned checkout aims to boost store conversions and simplify the customization of the checkout experience. FastCheckout offers fluid and intuitive navigation, ensuring a smoother buying experience.

We have made customization significantly easier, adapting the user experience to the specific needs of the Admin.
