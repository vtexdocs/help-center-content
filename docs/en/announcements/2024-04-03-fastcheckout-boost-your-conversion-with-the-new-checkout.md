Committed to continuously innovating and delivering excellence to our clients, VTEX introduces **FastCheckout**, the latest evolution of our checkout. This new solution allows us to create custom checkout experiences with high conversion rates and is constantly updated with new features.

## What has changed?

Previously, VTEX Checkout provided an outdated experience for clients and did not follow market innovation standards. Besides, all customization required CSS and Javascript code.

Now, to provide a more dynamic client experience, we have significantly improved the following aspects of VTEX Checkout:

- Experience optimized for conversion, based on research on the best user experiences according to the[ Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/).
- Support for high-end omnichannel options.
- High performance, even in carts with multiple items.
- Customizable layout and features.
- Optimization for mobile and desktop devices.
- Continuous updates to offer the best experience by examining new features.
- Option to place an order without registering.
- Option to accept multiple coupons by default.

### Easy customization

FastCheckout allows you to create a customizable checkout experience, adapting to the contexts and needs of your store. In FastCheckout, you can customize the following features via Admin, without any coding:

- Add the store logo to the checkout.
- Customize the checkout button and menu colors.
- Set limits for order quantities and cart total amount.
- Hide or add the **promo code**, **estimated shipping**, and **SKU price display** elements.
- Configure Adobe Analytics and Google Maps API.
- Add a text description you want to display to the customer.
- Deactivate and activate tax information within the **order summary**.

We allow you to add fully custom elements, without having to be familiar with JavaScript or CSS.

>⚠️ The first version released of FastCheckout allows limited customization. Soon, you will be able to fully customize the content using the FastStore Platform extensions.

### New purchase flow

The new purchase flow in FastCheckout is designed to be dynamic and intuitive, providing your customers with a more fluid and streamlined buying experience. We've made the checkout process more efficient with clear steps and intuitive navigation.

The redesigned checkout aims to boost store conversions and simplify the customization of the checkout experience. FastCheckout offers fluid and intuitive navigation, ensuring a smoother buying experience.

We have made customization significantly easier, adapting the user experience to the specific needs of the Admin.
