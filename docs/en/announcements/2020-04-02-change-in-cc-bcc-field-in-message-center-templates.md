## Which templates have been altered?

Starting from 04/15/2020, some of the Message Center module's templates will be altered. It won't possible to include the **CC/BCC** option in VTEX ID templates, which are sent during user login flow in your store. 

## Why are we deactivating the CC/BCC fields in VTEX ID templates?

It is a security measure to prevent vulnerabilities and sensitive data leaks. Confidential information, like the access code that users receive to log in, could be forwarded to others, for example. 

## Will this affect my store?

There is no justifiable CC/BCC use for this type of email, therefore we will deactivate this option for your store's security. There will be no negative impacts on purchase flows.
