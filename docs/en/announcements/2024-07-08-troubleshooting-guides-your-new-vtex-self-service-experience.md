VTEX is constantly evolving to enhance the customer support experience and empower our clients to solve problems more efficiently and autonomously.
To facilitate access to support, now you can use the Troubleshooting guides available in the [Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/subcategory/store-operations--2Q0IQjRcOqSgJTh6wRHVMB) and [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/troubleshooting). These guides detail potential error scenarios in store operations and during store or app development, as well as provide instructions on how to proceed to restore expected performance for your store.
