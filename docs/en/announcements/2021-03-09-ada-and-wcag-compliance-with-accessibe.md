Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. 

Making your website accessible is not only a step towards a more inclusive internet - it leads to higher scores in [accessibility audits](https://web.dev/lighthouse-accessibility/) and ensures that your store is compliant with [accessibility legislation](https://accessibe.com/compliance) such as [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) and [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). 

With the new [accessiBe Pixel app](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-accessibe-pixel/p), stores built with VTEX IO can quickly integrate with a solution to enhance the accessibility and usability of their website.

## What has changed? 
Stores built with VTEX IO can now integrate [accessiBe](https://accessibe.com/) pixel code to show an accessibility component in the storefront, presented as a settings button that gives accessibility options to the user. 

## Why did we perform this change? 
accessiBe is a service that implements the accessibility guidelines of ADA and WCAG, making your VTEX IO store compliant with these international parameters and increasing your audience without friction.

 ## What needs to be done? 
First, you need to sign up to an [accessiBe plan](https://accessibe.com/pricing) that suits your needs. Then, install the app from the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-accessibe-pixel/p) and follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-accessibe) to set up the integration.
