Mercado Pago Pro is one of the payment methods provided by the Mercado Pago [digital wallet](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-carteira-digital-e-wallet "digital wallet"). It allows customers to complete a purchase at Checkout without the need to log in to their account. 

From November 2020, VTEX clients using this payment method must migrate to the new version of Mercado Pago Pro. 

The upgrade will allow customers to be able to purchase without redirect.

## What changes?

Currently, Mercado Pago Proâ€™s purchase flow uses redirect; customers are redirected from Checkout to the Mercado Pago environment to complete their purchase.

The migration of Mercado Pago Pro will disable the flow that uses redirect. Its new version will allow purchases to be completed through VTEX's SmartCheckout.

## What do I need to do?

All VTEX clients using Mercado Pago Pro had the Payment App - a feature responsible for completing purchases in the VTEX environment - automatically installed in their accounts by our IT team.

Clients can now configure Mercado Pago Pro as a payment method associated with the MercadoPagoV1 Gateway affiliation.
