To simplify your physical store's checkout experience, we've developed the new Sales App checkout.
## What has changed?
With the new checkout, we have focused on optimizing and simplifying the buying journey. The checkout process now has well-defined steps and a carefully crafted navigation design to provide a more pleasant and efficient buying experience.

In addition, the new checkout allows selling products with personalized information, significantly expanding the range of sales possibilities. For example:

1. Sales associates can now enter a name to be printed on a t-shirt, creating unique and customized products for their customers.
2. They can also include a special message in a gift package, adding a personal and emotional touch to the purchase.
3. Serial numbers can be informed when selling jewelry, ensuring authenticity, and providing essential records for insurance or resale purposes.

You can fully configure this customization per SKU by [adding attachments](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-an-attachment--7zHMUpuoQE4cAskqEUWScU), giving you increased flexibility and adaptability to meet specific product requirements.

## Why did we make this change?
We made this change to the Sales App with the aim of better meeting your needs and expectations. Reflecting market trends, we recognized the importance of offering an improved, faster, and more efficient shopping experience.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required, as the update will be automatically applied to all VTEX stores using Sales App.
