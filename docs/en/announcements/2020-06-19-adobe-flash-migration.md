---

VTEX updated the CMS module due to the [Adobe Flash migration until the end of 2020](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome/). Previously, the buttons had Flash configuration but now they will be replaced with Javascript.

## What changes?

This update makes the CMS experience simpler, the new buttons will be identical to the old ones and to see them, you no longer need to enable Flash to your browser.
