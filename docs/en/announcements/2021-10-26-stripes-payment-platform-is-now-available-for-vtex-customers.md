As a global commerce solution, we are committed to helping our clients unlock the most popular payment methods no matter where they operate. Our payment strategy has an important role in enabling every region and the partnership with Stripe potentiates our reach.

Ease and diversity of payments are key to increasing conversion; after all, it gives customers the freedom and autonomy to choose how they want to pay.

With that in mind, VTEX has partnered with one of the largest and most technologically advanced payment platforms, [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

Stripe offers fair transfer conditions, adequate fees, intuitive operation, and many advantages, all in an outstanding service for a wide range of digital retail profiles.

## What are the advantages of using Stripe?

Besides providing a simplified integration with the most-used payment methods, Stripe offers many facilities and advantages that will optimize your ecommerce payments, such as:

- **Transparent checkout:** your customers will remain in your store environment during the entire shopping process.
- **Security:** Stripe is a service compliant with PCI Level 1, the highest level of security certification.
- **Global integration:** the integration of VTEX and Stripe is available in all countries where both companies operate, including local acquisitions in the US, Brazil, Mexico, UK, Italy, Spain, Romania, and Singapore, and international acquisitions in over 135 currencies.
- **Anti-fraud solution:** VTEX clients will be able to use Stripe’s features through the Stripe plug-in, including the Stripe Radar anti-fraud tool. Stripe Radar helps detect and block fraud using machine learning technology.
- **Payment diversity:** VTEX + Stripe partnership opens up new opportunities for clients and enables transactions using Google Play, Apple Pay, and local payment methods such as OXXO in Mexico and boleto bancário in Brazil.
