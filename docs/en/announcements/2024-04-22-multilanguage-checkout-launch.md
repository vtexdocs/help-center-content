We are introducing **Multilanguage Checkout**, a new feature designed to enhance your store's shopping experience, regardless of the country. As of 04/29/2024, your customers can enjoy an internationalized buying journey, from catalog browsing to the checkout process.

## What has changed?

With **Multilanguage Checkout**, we have implemented a complete solution that translates your product catalog into different languages previously added by merchants. This feature allows your customers to explore and buy products regardless of their language, providing a more fluid and customized shopping experience. The product and its information will be displayed in the same language on the storefront during browsing and at checkout.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required, as the update will be applied automatically to all VTEX stores as of 04/29/2024. If you want to add translations to the catalog, follow the instructions in the guide [Translating Catalog content](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/catalog-internationalization) to add them to your catalog.
