The main goal of running promotions is increasing the competitiveness of the store and, consequently, the conversion rate. This is possible by offering benefits that are financially attractive to buyers. A successful strategy to achieve this is using [coupons](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/cupons-beta--1aAEN3ADpz19ss5JCIEBdL) â€” codes that you can provide to the customers that allow them to apply promotions.

We updated the <i class="fas fa-bullhorn"></i> *Promotions & Taxes > Coupons* module in the VTEX Admin to include additional strategic information in the coupon list and provide more configuration possibilities when [creating new coupons](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criar-cupom-beta--7lMk3MmhNp2IEccyGApxU).

## What has changed?

The new [Coupons](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/cupons-beta--1aAEN3ADpz19ss5JCIEBdL) experience offers the following resources:

### New coupon list

The new [coupon list](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/lista-de-cupons-beta--5z5ya3IonsC2W4B5h4JrsZ) shows all the existing coupons in your store. This allows you to manage coupon data and analyze in which orders they were used.

### Easier access to coupon codes

You can export coupon codes to a CSV file or copy them to the clipboard and paste them directly into a spreadsheet.

### Integration with other modules

The update allows you to access promotions linked to a coupon and orders placed with each coupon.

### New filters

The new filters allow you to view coupons that meet specific criteria. The available filters are:

- Last modified
- Coupon type

### Coupon groups for agile management

Now, you can create up to 1,000 coupons in bulk and edit and archive all coupons in the same group.

### Coupon usage restriction

You can now restrict coupons to a specific number of uses in a store directly in the coupon edit page, rather than in the promotions linked to the coupon.

### New Coupons API

We added [new routes](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/promotions-and-taxes-api-v2#overview) for creating and managing coupon groups.

## Why did we make this change?

The aim of updating the Coupons module is to make everyday tasks in the feature easier for merchants by providing access to more comprehensive resources, such as bulk creation, and a more intuitive experience when creating and managing coupon codes.

## What needs to be done?

If your store uses the new VTEX Admin, go to <i class="fas fa-bullhorn"></i> *Promotions > Coupons*.

On the other hand, if your store uses previous Admin versions, go to *Products > Promotions & Taxes > Coupons*.
