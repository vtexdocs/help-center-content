Continuing the improvements made for [Mercado Libre certification](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/vtex-agora-e-oficialmente-um-parceiro-certificado-do-mercado-livre-no-brasil--34D14K2Y6ogJs3OxKpQUrJ), we are officially releasing the new interface for mapping categories and attributes to all VTEX clients that operate as sellers in Mercado Libre.

Prior to certification, sellers had to fill out the [mapping template](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/mapeamento-de-categorias-variacoes-e-atributos-do-mercado-libre--4xNFUZZmboCSUVdLCFo6eA) with the categories and attributes of the products they wanted to list on Mercado Libre. The new interface for mapping categories and attributes will replace the mapping template.

## What has changed?

To improve the experience of all our clients who use the [Mercado Libre integration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-do-mercado-livre--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq), we have developed an interface that simplifies the mapping of categories and attributes.

Using the [mapping template](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/mapeamento-de-categorias-variacoes-e-atributos-do-mercado-libre--4xNFUZZmboCSUVdLCFo6eA) to send products from your VTEX catalog to Mercado Libre will no longer be necessary. The template will be discontinued once the interface is available to all clients.

## Why did we make this change?

We understood that the mapping template was creating friction in the seller's experience, and that filling out the template incorrectly was causing errors in sending products to Mercado Libre.

After receiving feedback from our clients and realizing that the mapping experience could be smoother, we optimized the process of sending products through the Mercado Libre integration.

Now, you have access to an intuitive interface, and with a few clicks you can map the categories and attributes of the products in your VTEX catalog, resulting in a better seller experience.

## What needs to be done?

The new interface is already available for all our clients who use the Mercado Libre connector to list their products. To access it, click on **MARKETPLACE > Integrations > Settings**. In the *Mercado Libre card*, click on `Perform mapping`.

All clients who were using the mapping template to submit their products will no longer need to use it, and the template will be discontinued at the end of November 2021. The products that have already been mapped using the template will continue to be displayed on Mercado Libre. To submit new products, you will have to use the new mapping interface. 

To learn more about how to use the new interface, please refer to our article [Sending products to Mercado Libre](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-do-mercado-livre--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq/5XNeiye4rS4oao2MueSUeA).
