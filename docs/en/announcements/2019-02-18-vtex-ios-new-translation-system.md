---

We've launched the new __Messages App__, followed by major changes in the `MessagesBuilder`. The new features meet the needs of developers interested in a more complete translation system, which adds multilingual support to their front-end apps and the responses of back-end apps.


## How it used to be
Developing multi-language apps has always been considered a time-consuming process, especially with back-end apps. While front-end apps can be translated with internationalization libraries such as `react-intl`, back-end apps still require every string to be translated into a JSON file inside the `/messages` folder.

Adding up to those issues, language support is often limited by the developer's knowledge: It rarely extends beyond English, Portuguese, Spanish, and their mother tongue.


## What's new
The __Messages App__ is responsible for translating the strings of the entire IO platform. It will first try to translate its content from the translations defined by the user, then the appsâ€™ translations (defined in the `/messages` folder), and finally do a fallback to our automatic translation system. 


## Main advantages of the new Messages App 
- Allows both developer (human) and automatic (machine) translations for all strings throughout the VTEX IO platform.
- Supports every language available on the web.
- Lets you focus on the translation of the most critical strings, leaving the rest to our automatic system.
- Easier entry to new foreign markets.
- Faster development cycles with automatic translation.
