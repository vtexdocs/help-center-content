We have improved the way you manage your images in [Site Editor](https://help.vtex.com/en/subcategory/site-editor--9Arh3cJIOYlfSD1MUC2h3) through an Image Widget, a centralized image repository that allows you to upload and reuse your store’s images.

<div style="background-color:#cfe2ff; border-left: 2px solid #084298; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; padding: 16px">
  Image Widget is available in Open Beta for VTEX IO users.
</div> 

## What has changed?
Previously, you were able to upload pictures and use them on Site Editor. However, it was not possible to store or reuse them. 
Image Widget works as a modal repository, so now you can upload, store, and manage your store’s images.

## Why did we make this change?
The improvement aims to help VTEX clients manage their images in Site Editor and provides them with an image repository which allows them to: 
- Store and reuse images. 
- Use images on different pages of the storefront.
- Download images to their computers.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required. Image Widget is now available for blocks with the native image upload option.
