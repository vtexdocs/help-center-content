One of the main advantages of VTEX Smartcheckoutâ„¢ is that it makes it easier for customers to repurchase. Customers simply need to enter their email addresses for their data to be filled in. And to complete the purchase, all they need to do is enter the security code of their previously saved cards. The entire process is fast and safe. 

To continue enhancing this experience, we have included additional validation in the purchase flow to better handle expired cards.

## What changed?

Previously, customers could select an expired card, proceed with a purchase, and then the payment would be declined. We now flag expired cards and prevent them from being chosen at checkout, in order to offer a smoother shopping experience.

## Why did we make this change?

Despite being an unusual event in the customer experience, this scenario used to lead to some confusion that could negatively affect the conversion rate of stores with a high volume of transactions. Our team is continuously looking for opportunities to improve the stores' buying experience.

## What needs to be done?

Nothing! All stores have been updated with this new feature and will now have fewer payment problems due to expired cards.
