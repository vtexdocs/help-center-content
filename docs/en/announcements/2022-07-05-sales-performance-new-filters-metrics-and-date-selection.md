The [Sales Performance](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/sales-performance--6gx46RGRzWO8qgaVck7PRp) page is constantly evolving to allow retailers to extract more business intelligence from VTEX. 

We understand the importance of bringing more control to your analyses, allowing you to compare different aspects of your operation. This is why we have launched more filter options and a new date selection feature on the Sales Performance page. 

## What has changed?

We have updated the interface of the Sales Performance page so that it contains the new features described below.

### New period selection experience

Before, the page only allowed retailers to select fixed periods, such as "Last week". You can now [select periods](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/sales-performance--6gx46RGRzWO8qgaVck7PRp#period) by choosing the desired start and end dates in the calendar within the last 90 days. 

### New filter dimensions

We have included the following [filter dimensions](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/sales-performance--6gx46RGRzWO8qgaVck7PRp#filter-dimensions-and-data-grouping), connecting more VTEX systems to your Sales Performance dashboard:

* Trade policy
* Promotions
* UTM Campaign
* UTM Source

## Why did we make this change?

We have changed the period selection feature to give retailers more freedom when filtering data by the period of their choice, so they can analyze important dates in their sales calendar. We listened to our customers and this was a request that was present in 46% of the feedback sent to us about improvements to the Sales Performance page.

The goal of the new filter dimensions is to refine your data exploration, offering an increasingly holistic view of your business with the different modules of the VTEX platform.

## What needs to be done?

This update is only available to stores operating with the [New VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/welcome-to-the-redesigned-vtex-admin--5tLPBodp6Xu03vYdyBTGTa). 

No action is required. The page has been automatically updated in your VTEX Admin under the **Dashboards** menu. Learn more in [Sales Performance](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/sales-performance--6gx46RGRzWO8qgaVck7PRp).
