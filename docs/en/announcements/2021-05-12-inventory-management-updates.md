---


The logistics of your store requires you to keep your inventory up to date to avoid availability issues when users place their orders. To edit your inventory, go to the **Inventory & Shipping** module and click** Inventory management**. On this page, you can view and update the number of items in stock and track the inventory history. 

## **What has changed?**

The name of the feature has changed from _Inventory_ to **Inventory management**, and the user interface has been revamped. With this update, you can now edit the number of items in stock without having to access another page. Besides, all items in stock will be displayed on the same page.

## **Why did we make this change?**

The change aims to facilitate inventory management by providing you with the following features:

*   Search for specific products and SKUs.
*   Filter SKUs by reserved and available statuses, or by warehouse.
*   Check the number of items in stock for each SKU.
*   Update the number of items in stock manually.
*   Set an infinite inventory for specific SKUs.
*   View inventory update history.

## **What needs to be done?**

No action is needed. The update is being rolled out since October 2020 to all accounts that use version 3.0 or later of the VTEX Admin.

The accounts that are already using the new Inventory management and the ones eligible for the update will no longer have access to the previous Inventory. Only accounts that do not have the updated version of the VTEX Admin will continue using the previous Inventory.
