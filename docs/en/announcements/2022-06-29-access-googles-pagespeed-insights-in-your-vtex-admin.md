In the digital commerce market, providing an experience that does not allow the shopper to wait too long to find the information they need or to complete an order can be the competitive advantage between brands, racing for the same user's attention. Therefore, tracking your website's performance is important to measure and improve user experience, leading to a potential increase in sales.

This is why we created the new [Web Page Performance](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/web-page-performance--7DeyhX8cGtG9PtAGkL8zvc) screen, bringing Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) tools to your VTEX Admin.

PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse are tools developed by Google to report on the user experience of a page on both mobile and desktop devices, providing suggestions on how that page may be improved. They use [Google's Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals) as metrics to assess online user experience.

## What has changed?

Previously, if you wanted to assess your website's performance based on the Core Web Vitals, you had to access Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) or [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), adding single URLs on their interface.

Now you do not have to leave your VTEX Admin to track your website's performance and view opportunities for improvements. 

Webpage Performance includes the features present in Google's tool and is built using our new Design System. It is also the only interface that allows you to add multiple URLs to constantly assess the performance of each webpage — instead of checking URLs individually in PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse.

## Why did we make this change?

Tracking and assessing the performance of a digital store is an important exercise to become even more competitive in a market, since good user experience often leads to better business outcomes and sales conversions. Web Page Performance helps merchants track the performance experience of the main pages of their ecommerce, while also finding out the reasons behind a slower performance. 

Before we included the Webpage Performance page, merchants needed to access Google's PageSpeed Insights to track URLs individually. With the new page, they can add the desired URLs to be constantly tracked, and now have this data centralized within your VTEX Admin.

Additionally, by combining PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse on the same screen, we facilitate the debugging and assessment done by developers when deploying new features for a website. 

## What needs to be done?

Webpage Performance is automatically available only for stores operating with the [Redesigned VTEX Admin](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/welcome-to-the-redesigned-vtex-admin--5tLPBodp6Xu03vYdyBTGTa). To access it, on the side menu of your Admin, click on **Dashboards > Webpage Performance**. 

If your store is still using previous Admin versions, [join the Beta program](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/?utm_source=announcement&utm_medium=help_center&utm_campaign=webpage_performance) for the Redesigned VTEX Admin to gain access to Web Page Performance.
