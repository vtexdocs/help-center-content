The feature allows retailers to segment their customer base and offer different payment conditions for each group. 

It is an optional feature. If the retailer does not want to use it, it will not affect the operation of Customer Credit. 

## Advantages

Stores that offer multiple payment options to customers increase the sales reach of their business. However, expanding for the sake of expansion is not necessarily strategic.

Combining the clustering feature with payment methods allows customers to build specific sales strategies for certain customer niches. 

This is an excellent opportunity to customize payment methods according to partner needs in the Business to Business context.

## How it works

To configure Customer Credit as a payment method, the first step is to set rules for payment terms and installments. 

Once this is done, you can define whether these rules will be valid for one or more customers.
