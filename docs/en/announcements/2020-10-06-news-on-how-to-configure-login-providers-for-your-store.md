The login providers configuration screen in your VTEX store admin has a new interface. As of October 21st, you will be able to access the new interface in **Account Settings** > **Authentication** in your admin menu. For more information, read [this article](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/integracao-google-e-facebook-para-login--tutorials_513 "Configure login with Facebook and Google").

While the screen design has been improved, the content of the configuration fields has not changed. The same Client ID and Client Secret are still being used in the configuration. All login provider information previously contained in the Authentication dashboard remains the same.
