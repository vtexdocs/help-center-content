announcementSynopsisEN: 'Physical store sales reps can now sell via WhatsApp or social media using inStore Social Selling.'
---

inStore is VTEX's main product for Unified Commerce operations. It’s an app that enables your store to provide a true omnichannel experience, seamlessly integrating your online and physical channels, and placing your customers at the business core.

Now, your physical store sales reps can make sales over WhatsApp or other social media using inStore Social Selling. This feature makes it possible to share a full cart link, so that your store's customers can complete the purchase on their own devices.

By using inStore Social Selling, you can create activation actions for a specific product, and keep a close relationship with your customers, sending cart suggestions according to their profile.

## What has changed?

Previously, cart sharing wasn’t possible on inStore, [only through ecommerce](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-use-the-shareable-cart-app--3ePPpkmeZ96GXbeIoGZbTN).

With inStore Social Selling, your physical store sales reps can select products and generate a link to share the **Cart Suggestion** with one or more customers via WhatsApp, as shown below. It is also possible to copy the link and share it on other social media.

The sales rep can share the same link with several customers, as many times as they want. Every time someone opens this link, a new shopping cart is generated, exactly like the one created on inStore. Each cart accessed is also linked to the sales rep account and their code, if any.

The customers can access the cart, make the payment, and complete the purchase on their own mobile phone, tablet, or computer.

The sales rep can also fill in the customer's delivery information, choose the payment method, and then share a **Payment Link**. That way, the shared cart link will have all the personal information already filled in, so the customer will only need to fill in the payment information to complete the purchase on their own device.  Check out how it works.

## Why did we make this change?

The goal of this feature is to empower physical store sales reps and enable sales across multiple channels, favoring a unified commerce strategy.
