We have updated the way you can submit product prices via the [Google Shopping integration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/2kGKxwD9HKJvTLDTikQ4zG), enabling merchants to offer more attractive offers and discounts using [payment methods](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/diferenca-entre-meios-de-pagamento-e-condicoes-de-pagamento--3azJenhGFyUy2gsocms42Q) that best meet their customer needs.

## What has changed?

Previously, merchants could see the **Consider discount for boleto payment in the submitted price** option when setting up [Google Shopping integration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/2kGKxwD9HKJvTLDTikQ4zG), which has been replaced by the __Apply discount to submitted price__ option. With the update, VTEX stores can use one of the two options below to configure the price sent to Google Shopping:
- __Submit base price (for discount prices):__ Only displays products with a [list price](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3XcXp0r5WrJvogB8KIX4Kx#list-price).
- __Apply discount to submitted price:__ Google Shopping will display the VTEX store's products with the associated discount and payment method.

>⚠️ The **Apply discount to submitted price** setting is only available for VTEX stores in Brazil.

## What needs to be done?

As of December 14, 2023, the update will be available to all [VTEX accounts acting as sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#being-a-vtex-seller).
Accounts not using the Google Shopping integration but wanting to activate the __Submit base price (for discount prices)__ and __Apply discount to submitted price__ settings should follow [this article track](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/2kGKxwD9HKJvTLDTikQ4z) to start using the new settings. Accounts that are integrated with Google Shopping and have the __Consider discount for boleto payment in the submitted price__ setting active will automatically have the __Apply discount to submitted price__ option active after the update, as shown in the image below:
