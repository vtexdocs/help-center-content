To analyze and monitor the performance of [VTEX lntelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG), you can see and export [reports](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3JcuptYAkwr1GLZEM3IQ2m#) with data related to searches made in the store. To allow a more comprehensive analysis of the search performance, we include the metrics of [Autocomplete](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/4gXFsEWjF7QF7UtI2GAvhL#) in these reports.

## What changed?
Previously it was only possible to see, and export reports on search results and terms used in the search. Now it is also possible to analyze the performance of search suggestions made by Autocomplete.

<table width = "100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src = "https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/34n3YHcet5J5gHNNLwLw3r/092ec32f2cc0c2f4fb8254b3327006fd/relatorios-filtros-EN.png" style = "display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt = "Opções de filtros do relatório" title = "Opções de filtros do relatório">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style = "text-align: center;">
     <em>
      Now you can select Autocomplete as a filter for your reports
     </em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Why did we make this change?
The combination of filters allows a more comprehensive analysis of the search performance; it is also possible to develop strategies that use these scenarios to improve the customer experience.
