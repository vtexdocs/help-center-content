Every day we see the potential of multiple sales channels in our customers' operations. When we think of marketplaces in Latin America, Mercado Livre is one of the main players when it comes to expanding your sales capacity. For this reason, we have been offering native integration with this service since 2014.

We are excited to share the latest improvements and new features that will help you sell more and better with Mercado Livre. There are two important improvements:

## Buy Box: a new way to advertise and sell on Mercado Livre

In the second half of 2019, Mercado Livre started offering a new way to showcase and advertise its products. This new model is called the [Buy Box](https://vendedores.mercadolivre.com.br/notas/chegou-o-catalogo-uma-nova-forma-de-vender-mais/). It allows the buyer to find all the price offers for the same product much faster. The idea is simple: when a buyer does a search, the first result will always be the Buy Box product. That is where Mercado Livre consolidates the best prices of several sellers for that product and displays them in the best possible way. If your offer is the best one, it will be the first to appear - generating more sales and results.

### How does it work?

From the moment you activate the Buy Box option in the [Mercado Livre settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/mercado-libre-integration-set-up--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq/4YvYdgICMosaEgISOYogsi), all synchronized products will be eligible for the Buy Box. When eligible, the integration automatically creates a catalog ad using all the details, technical data, images and description of that product that are maintained by Mercado Livre. The price and stock information will be synchronized and will compete for the best position in the Buy Box. If your product is well positioned, it will appear as the first buying option. It means that you won't have to worry about SEO or how products are showcased, just about offering the best price and delivery.

But it does not stop there. Another novelty of our integration also seeks to improve your performance:

## Run premium and classic ads simultaneously.

The second improvement involves the way that Mercado Livre receives and promotes product ads. For the marketplace, there are two types of ads through integration: Classic and Premium. Each represents a type of offer, with different rates, discounts and commission.

Until then, the VTEX client could only integrate its catalog and choose an ad type. You would either offer Premium ads, or Classic ads. Now, every VTEX customer will be able to run both types of ads simultaneously. Just configure the two integrations on the panel, according to the [documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/mercado-libre-integration-set-up--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq/2MR2USqcvDGaoAkGNdCfGi).

This means more flexibility to configure and provide the best offers for each product and competition, giving you the freedom to develop the best strategy possible.
