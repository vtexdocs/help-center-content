You can now make pickup points available for subscription orders. This delivery option can be chosen when creating subscriptions [at checkout](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-a-assinatura--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453?&utm_source=autocomplete#adicionar-produtos-para-assinatura-durante-o-checkout) or via the [Subscriptions API](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/subscriptions-1#post_api-rns-pub-subscriptions).

The pickup points feature for subscriptions is available in beta only for accounts using the **Checkout V6**.

## What has changed?

Previously, pickup was not a delivery option available for subscriptions. With this feature, end customers can choose pickup points for items in a subscription order at checkout, as illustrated in the image below.

You can also assign pickup points to new and existing subscriptions via the[ Subscriptions API](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/subscriptions-1).

## Why did we make this change?

By offering more delivery options for subscription orders, you give more freedom to your end customers. They can now choose the best way to receive their orders and the most convenient pickup point. These factors contribute to a better buying experience.
