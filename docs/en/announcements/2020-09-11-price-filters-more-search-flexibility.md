announcementSynopsisEN: 'For your price management to be more dynamic, we developed more filter settings options'
---

For your price management to be more dynamic, we developed more filter settings options that will enhance your experience.

Previously, it was only possible to search for prices through the search bar or by using one filter at a time. In order to refine the search results, we created the option of combining filters in the Price List.

Now you can filter prices by combining multiple Categories and Brands, as well as the `Active` and `Inactive` statuses - all in one search.

This update enables you to export more specific prices from filter selection.

## What do I need to do?
To use this new configuration, follow the steps below:

1. Access the **Prices** module.
2. Click on **Price list**.
3. On the left side of the search bar, click on the <i class="fas fa-filter" title = "filtro"></i> icon.
4. Choose the desired filter criteria.
5. Click on the <i class="fas fa-times" title = "X"></i> icon to close the window and view the Price List with the filter applied.
