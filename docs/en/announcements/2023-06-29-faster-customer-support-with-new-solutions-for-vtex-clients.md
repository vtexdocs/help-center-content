We are excited to introduce the latest customer service solution from VTEX. Now, you'll have access to a service bot powered by extensive platform knowledge. With Artificial Intelligence, you will enjoy **prompt and wait-free assistance**, with **tailored conversational capabilities **to meet your demands.

### What has changed?

When opening a [support ticket](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) of type 'Technical', you will have access to a new real-time conversation screen with the VTEX bot where you can clarify any doubt about the platform. The bot supports **multiple languages** and has been trained with **all the VTEX available knowledge base**.

Even with this new support option, you can choose at any moment to **continue the assistance with our Support team of experts**, following the SLAs defined in your [region's service policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/como-funciona-o-suporte-da-vtex--3kACEfni4m8Yxa1vnf2ebe).

### Limited availability in beta version

This is a beta version of the service. Initially, the bot will only be available in selected regions.

Important points to consider:

- Conversations may be shared with third-party software to improve our service.
- Do not share information that could identify your account, company, customers, employees, or your company's confidential information via chat.
- We are committed to continually improving bot responses. However, it may occasionally provide inconsistent information. You can continue to count on our Help Center, Developer Portal and calls for our support.
