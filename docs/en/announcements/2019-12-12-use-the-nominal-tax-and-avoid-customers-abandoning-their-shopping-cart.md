The Merchandising, Promotions & Taxes team released a new feature called **Nominal Tax**.

## Benefits

The tool is useful for a number of business strategies, including to avoid having the order burdened with an additional tax at the end of the purchase cycle, thereby avoiding that customers abandon the cart. 

The functionality can be used whenever retailers want to opt for a fixed product tax instead of a variable one, in addition to being able to use the functionality according to a business strategy or technical requirement, such as an ERP integration that only accepts whole numbers; or it may even be used to make internal product tax declarations easier to process.

## How to use

- Open the main menu
- Under Products, choose the Promotions & Taxes options
- Click on Taxes
- Click on the green New Tax button
- Under "What kind and amount of tax?", choose the Nominal tax option
- Fill in the required fields and click on save
