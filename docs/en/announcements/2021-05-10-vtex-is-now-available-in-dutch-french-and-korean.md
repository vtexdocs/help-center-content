announcementSynopsisEN: 'VTEX Admin has three new language options.'
---

The VTEX admin currently supports different language options to serve our clients all over the world. We localize our product to enhance its overall experience, not only through translations but also on a cultural level, taking into account the particularities of each country.

![EN new locales](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4ymaJnFYZxRTjTZmoD54Gy/aa4557f81746ab4e3735b07aaf4085a0/EN_new_locales.jpg)

## What has changed?
In addition to Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, Romanian and Japanese, starting May 2021, VTEX users will find three new language options in our Admin: Dutch, French and Korean. 

## Why did we make this change?
The addition of  three new languages to our VTEX admin was driven by our clients' operations in Belgium and Korea, and our future expansion to other countries, better serving our global customers in multiple regions.

## What do you need to do
To view the VTEX admin in the new languages, select NL for Dutch, FR for French or KR for Korean from the language dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen.
