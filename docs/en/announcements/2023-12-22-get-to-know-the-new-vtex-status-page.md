Working on incidents is crucial to the tenant experience, which is why we've made the process as transparent and informative as possible. We've redesigned the platform's status page ([status.vtex.com](https://status.vtex.com/)) to improve how we communicate maintenance events and incidents.

## What has changed?

Previously, we faced challenges by categorizing incidents into four components: Checkout, WebStore, Administrative Environment, and Internal Modules. In some situations, the broad categorization did not accurately reflect the real impact of the incident. For example, an issue with a payment connector could be tagged as a problem in the Checkout component, leading to miscommunication about the extent of the issue.

Now, we have introduced 18 more specific components, grouped into four categories: Storefront, Checkout, Admin, and Developer Tools. This approach focuses not only on our internal architecture but mainly on where merchants can see the symptoms. The following image shows all the components displayed on the new page:

Check out the [VTEX Status page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-status-page--gPhqDn9IQ3c67wbJEX3JJ) article for more information on each component.

## Why did we make this change?

We have updated the platform's status page to provide a more transparent and contextualized communication experience during and after incidents and scheduled maintenance, allowing merchants to better understand the real impact on their operations.
