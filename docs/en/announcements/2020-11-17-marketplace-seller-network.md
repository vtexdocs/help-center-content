Picture expanding your revenue streams with less investment and way more velocity. One of the main challenges for marketplaces and sellers from our ecosystem is to connect with new partners to expand their offers and reach. With that in mind, we've developed the new Marketplace Seller Network.

## How does it work?
By connecting with a network of marketplaces and sellers, you will have the opportunity to expand your sales channels and increase your product portfolio, unlocking new revenue streams with less risk and quicker return on investment. The idea is simple: 

- __Download the App__: Access our [App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/marketplace-seller-network/p "App Store") and install the app with a few clicks.
- __Sign up__: Sign up as a seller or marketplace and join our network.
- __Search__: Look for strategic partners in your industry and business model.
- __Connect__: Get in touch with the selected partners and receive messages from partners interested in your business.

That's it! Once connected, you will be able to negotiate your commercial partnerships directly. 

## Let's start?
