The product and SKU details page was redesigned to improve your experience when adding, viewing and editing products and SKUs. The new page is available in beta.

## What has changed?

The new pages load faster and provide a more intuitive experience, including improved image management.

All SKUs for the same product are now gathered on a single page, making it easier to edit multiple SKUs.
