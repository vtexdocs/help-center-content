announcementSynopsisEN: 'The flag "Use VTEX keys" has been disabled and the retailer needs to set up his own'
---

Login via Facebook and Google is a powerful feature used by hundreds of VTEX stores. And the configuration of this functionality has changed. So stay tuned.

The flag __Use VTEX keys__, which previously activated the use of data provided by VTEX for login operation, has been disabled.

This means that the stream has been fixed and it is no longer possible to use VTEX keys to login with Facebook and Google. Now retailers need to set up their own keys.

This change does not have any negative impact on your store. However, if some customization was done wrongly on your login screen, crashes may occur. So check out your login screen to make sure everything goes like it used to.
