A big challenge for marketplaces and sellers in our ecosystem is connecting with new partners to expand their offerings and reach. The [Marketplace Network](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/encontre-marketplaces-e-sellers-no-ecossistema-vtex--2bzC7tXlVgLEEjxo4ixcAM) module facilitates this connection by acting as a catalog of marketplaces and sellers interested in partnerships. It allows them to register, consult and contact potential partners.

The Marketplace Network has been revamped to improve your experience. In addition, it is no longer necessary to download the app from our App Store, as the feature has been automatically added to all stores that act as sellers or marketplaces.

## What has changed?
The Marketplace Network pages have undergone some changes:

- We have separated the *Find Marketplaces* and *Find Sellers* pages into two different tabs for a more assertive search.  
- We have include important information in the registration form, such as location.    
- We have improved the way you contact partners, streamlining the process.  

Previously, to access the app, you had to download it from our App Store. It has now been automatically installed in all VTEX Admins that are marketplaces or sellers. 

## Why did we make this change?
We have improved the Marketplace Network module experience to make it easier for sellers and marketplaces to connect, unlocking new revenue streams and faster returns. 

New contact flows and fields added to profiles make it much easier to find partners aligned with your business strategies. The module now facilitates partner hunting by accelerating the process of finding and contacting new partners.

By automatically installing the feature in stores, we have increased the number of sellers and marketplaces on the network, enabling new connections for your business. 

## What needs to be done?
To use the Marketplace Network, you need to create a profile for your business, in order to be found by potential partners. To do so, log in to your VTEX Admin and go to  *Marketplace > Marketplace Network > Store Profile*. 

Once you've registered, simply navigate the *Find Sellers* and *Find Marketplaces* tabs to find and contact potential partners.
