A new feature is now available for [VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-usando-o-app--4BYzQIwyOHvnmnCYQgLzdr/6cq4E1JCmA6vCvBCCtAgIM): promotions on the search page, which allow merchants to highlight special offers directly in the search results of the Product Listing Page (PLP).

## Why did we make this change?
We have developed this feature so that merchants can highlight special offers directly in the search results of the Product Listing Page (PLP). We aim to promote greater interaction between your store and customers and increase the visibility of products containing multiple promotions.

## What needs to be done?
No action is required, as the feature will be automatically applied to all stores using VTEX Sales App. For more information, go to Promotions on the [Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/promocao-na-pagina-de-busca-do-sales-app--2g9JmTLKYASz8jxme2pyc9) search page
