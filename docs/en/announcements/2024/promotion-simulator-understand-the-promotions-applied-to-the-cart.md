We have launched the **Promotion Simulator** for all VTEX stores globally. It is a new tool that allows you to see the promotions applied to the cart in your store, along with their activation conditions. 

Given the multiple options for configuring [promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/promotions--6asfF1vFYiZgTQtOzwJchR/2a2D0K85Ahvs4hLnL3Ag7N), this feature provides a clear view of competing and accumulated promotions and conditions to activate them.

We created the **Promotion Simulator** to give merchants more autonomy to manage and run promotions based on their business strategies. With the new tool, you can explore and streamline the performance of your promotions while ensuring a more efficient operation and an enhanced shopping experience for your customers.

## What's new?

From now on, the **Promotion Simulator** will be available for all VTEX stores via [Cartman](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configure-cartman--1ACMTStZYkMqB0lTgwg451), an auxiliary tool for merchants at checkout. The simulator allows you to:

* **View the promotions** applicable or applied to each item in the cart and the condition to activate them.
* **Manage existing promotions** through the cart.
* **Test removing promotions** applied to the cart.
* **Test applying** other promotions to the cart before activating them, including scheduled or inactive promotions.
* **Understand the reasons** a promotion was not applied to the cart.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required, as the **Promotion Simulator** is now available in all VTEX stores via [Cartman](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configure-cartman--1ACMTStZYkMqB0lTgwg451).

Users must have a [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) authorized to access the **Promotions** module in the VTEX Admin to access the **Promotion Simulator**. 

To start using the simulator, follow these instructions:

1. In the top bar of the VTEX Admin, click the` Preview` button to open your store's restricted access page. 

    Alternatively, you can access it directly via the URL `https://{accountname}.myvtex.com`, replacing `{accountname}` with your VTEX account name.

2. Add products to the cart and proceed to checkout at `https://{accountname}.myvtex.com/checkout/#/cart`.
3. Click the blue button <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/announcements/2024/promotion-simulator-understand-the-promotions-applied-to-the-cart_2.png" alt="cartman-icon" width="25"/> in the bottom right corner of the page to launch Cartman.
4. Click **Promotion Simulator**.

   In the new window, you will see the details of promotions applied and not applied to the cart.
