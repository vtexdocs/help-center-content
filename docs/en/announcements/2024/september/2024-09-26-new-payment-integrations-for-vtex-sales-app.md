To improve the operations of VTEX Sales App in your store, VTEX has made two new payment integration options available: __Cielo__ and __Mercado Pago__.

## What has changed?
From now on, in addition to the integration with [Adyen](/en/docs/tutorials/configuring-payment-with-adyenv3-in-vtex-sales-app), you can also use __Cielo__ and __Mercado Pago__ to process payment transactions with VTEX Sales App, giving you greater flexibility in determining which payment provider is best suited to meet your business needs.

> ℹ️ New payment integration options are constantly being developed for VTEX Sales App. You can access the [List of Payment Providers by Country](/en/docs/tutorials/list-of-payment-providers-by-country) at any time and filter the search by "Sales App" to check the current provider availability.
