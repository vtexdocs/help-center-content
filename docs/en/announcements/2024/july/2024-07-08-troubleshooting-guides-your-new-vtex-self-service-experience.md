VTEX is constantly evolving to enhance the customer support experience and empower our clients to solve problems more efficiently and autonomously.
To facilitate access to support, now you can use the Troubleshooting guides available in the [Help Center](/subcategory/store-operations--2Q0IQjRcOqSgJTh6wRHVMB) and [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/troubleshooting). These guides detail potential error scenarios in store operations and during store or app development, as well as provide instructions on how to proceed to restore expected performance for your store.

## How are the Troubleshooting guides organized?

- [Help Center](/category/troubleshooting--39pDkp8qxSll6mGj0tWViz):
  - [Store operations](/subcategory/store-operations--2Q0IQjRcOqSgJTh6wRHVMB): This section focuses on solving the difficulties with platform and ecommerce operations.

- [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/troubleshooting)
  - **Development**: This section is designed to address errors related to storefront and app development.
  - **Store performance**: This section includes procedures for debugging errors and restoring the store to operational condition if it is down or malfunctioning.

> ℹ️ At the time of this announcement's publication, 15 guides are available for consultation, with more in production.

## Why did we create this initiative?
Our goal is to simplify and streamline the VTEX support experience. With the new Troubleshooting guides, you can:

- **Identify problems more quickly:** The descriptions of store operation and development scenarios will help you identify the problems you may be experiencing.
- **Find solutions for each case presented:** The guides contain procedures that explain the necessary steps to resolve errors.
- **Gain greater autonomy in fault management:** You will be able to resolve errors internally, at any time, without the need to contact technical support.
