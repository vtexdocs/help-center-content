We have developed new features for the Received SKUs page to improve the interaction between the marketplace and seller when approving SKUs.  

The new experience offers a streamlined visualization model for offers sent by sellers and new configuration options, all in one place.   

## What has changed?

Previously, the **Received SKUs** module allowed the following actions: Link to an existing SKU or product, Approve a new product, and Reject a product.  
Now, in addition to providing a segmented view of incoming offers, the marketplace can:  

- **Create new products with multiple SKUs.**  
- **Add blocking reasons.**  
- **Unblock SKUs.**  
- **Request SKU fixes.**  

## What needs to be done?

The new **Received SKUs** experience has been available for testing on all VTEX accounts since September 2, 2024. 
To explore the new architecture of the page and all its available features, see **[Received SKUs](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/skus-recebidos-beta--4hxDUmbgOEVFSTU2Eqi8DK).**
