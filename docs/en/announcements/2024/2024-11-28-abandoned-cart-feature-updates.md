Weâ€™ve updated the [Abandoned Cart](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-carrinho-abandonado--tutorials_740) event capture system to provide more accurate data on abandoned carts and the triggers generated via [Master Data](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw).  
## What has changed?

Previously, a cart was considered abandoned after 30 minutes of customer inactivity.  

Now, the cart can be considered abandoned through a statistical analysis conducted by algorithms. These algorithms the average time between the customer's first access to the store and making a purchase.  

This behavior generates more accurate cart event triggers, improving the efficiency of [recovery campaigns](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-carrinho-abandonado--tutorials_740#:~:text=a%20VTEX.-,Configurar%20trigger,-Nesta%20etapa%20ser%C3%A1) implemented in stores.  

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The new Abandoned Cart version will be available for all VTEX accounts as of December 5, 2024. Learn more about the feature in [Setting up Cart Abandonment (Trigger)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-carrinho-abandonado--tutorials_740).
