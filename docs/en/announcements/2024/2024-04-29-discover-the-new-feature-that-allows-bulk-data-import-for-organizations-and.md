VTEX now offers a new feature for bulk data import, designed to streamline the process of updating and maintaining information for buyer organizations, their users (members), and cost centers.

## What has changed?

From now on, stores using the [B2B Suite](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.b2b-suite) can import buyer organizations, cost centers, and members using a **XLSX file** or the [Bulk Import API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/buyer-organizations?endpoint=overview). 

## Why did we make this change?

Our aim is to make data management in buyer organizations more efficient.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The feature will be available to all stores with the B2B Suite app installed.
