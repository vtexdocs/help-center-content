With client success in mind, VTEX offers complete solutions for different business models. This puts the flexibility of composable commerce at the service of innovation and growth in your operation.

To help you easily adopt new resources, manage your business autonomously, and gain scalability, we have published the new **Onboarding guide** — content covering the complete journey for operating a VTEX store. This documentation will be available in the [Start here](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks) section of the Help Center.

## What is the Onboarding guide?

The **Onboarding guide** is a collection of three documentation tracks, which include planning the store architecture, go-live configurations, products to help evolve your business, and guidelines about our support. The guide describes and contextualizes the platform settings and resources within the VTEX store journey.

The **Onboarding guide** has three tracks:

- [VTEX store overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9)
- [Next steps after the go-live](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/next-steps-after-the-go-live--3J7WFZyvTcoiwkcIVFVhIS)
- [Support at VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy)

> ℹ️ The tracks include content that complement one another, but they are intended to be standalone. This means you can explore the content freely, without following any specific order.

Our aim is to allow clients, partners, and the VTEX ecosystem to take advantage of the **Onboarding guide**. We took into account a comprehensive journey to make sure the content stayed relevant for different businesses.

You can find an [overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9) of the guide content below.

</div>

The **VTEX store track** describes the initial context of the operation, starting by defining the [account type and architecture](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl) that best suit the business needs. From there, you can complete the [initial setup](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4EPwTXx5oFdSG1dA3zIchz) and configure the platform [modules](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/75MX4aorniD0BYAB8Nwbo7), focusing on getting the operation going. Once the [backend integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu) are completed and the [frontend](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/67SCtUreXxKYWhZh8n0zvZ) technology has been implemented in order to build the storefront, it's time for the [go-live](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/6xYnNxDHUcY6FyChgziCoH) and launching the new store.

</div>

The **Next steps after go-live** track describes how [unified commerce](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/next-steps-after-the-go-live--3J7WFZyvTcoiwkcIVFVhIS/5Qvw31yH2FPDBl14K5xXHA) is achieved with the platform resources, including [module settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/next-steps-after-the-go-live--3J7WFZyvTcoiwkcIVFVhIS/V1fs7IkfYMfn91ZVHTLu4) not mentioned before. The aim here is to focus on evolving the operation. This track also describes VTEX's [add-on products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/next-steps-after-the-go-live--3J7WFZyvTcoiwkcIVFVhIS/1t2QBZvrOBSLgvHaAV9fYm), which are products that can be requested separately for implementing new strategies and diversifying the business.

</div>

The **VTEX Support** track describes the [support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/7w7cUmbrdPEKpTMItjXEB8) offered by VTEX to clients, which is not restricted to a specific part of the journey. Other tracks also mention [how support works](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/2Ik9CGbPeZIHHaYFsuyId3), since [opening a ticket](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/6EboD7Y1BOLlWdT8JM15EE) is the designated channel for certain requests. The organization of this track aims to help our clients have the best experiences with our services, providing all the necessary information for opening tickets, whether for [technical](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3thRAdTB3gGwTB0e1fVL3T), [billing](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3g2mhmPDx5GszNgLDICzsl), or [commercial](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3KQWGgkPOwbFTPfBxL7YwZ) support.

## Why did we create this content?

We organized the **Onboarding guide** to provide autonomy for our clients. Here are some highlights about the guide:

- **Complete journey:** This is the first documentation that covers the complete operational journey of a VTEX store. The content is designed to make go-live faster and reduce the _time to revenue_ of the business.
- **Brand-new content:** In addition to the new approach of the journey, there is brand-new content, with the following highlights in the _VTEX store track_ ([Accounts and architecture](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl), [Backend integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu), [Frontend implementation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/67SCtUreXxKYWhZh8n0zvZ)), in the _Next steps after the go-live track_ ([Add-on products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/next-steps-after-the-go-live--3J7WFZyvTcoiwkcIVFVhIS/1t2QBZvrOBSLgvHaAV9fYm)), and the _VTEX Support track_ as a whole.
- **General relevance:** The value of this guide is not restricted to new clients or stores in the phases before go-live. We envisioned a comprehensive journey to make it relevant for different business models.

We hope this content contributes to the success of your business and your satisfaction with VTEX.
