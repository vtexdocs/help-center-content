announcementSynopsisEN: 'This tool allows to control order approvals with changes in their values.'
---

This tool allows to control order approvals with changes in their values. The changes exist in two ways:
1. Through possible asynchronies with the prices of a marketplace.
2. Through manual discounts, which can be applied by admins or telesales operators of the store.

## What changes? 
Now, instead of opening a ticket directly with the support, you can manage the authorization rules by admin. To do this, go to the path: Menu - Order Management - Order Authorization.

## What you need to do
It is important to mention that the store will not lose the previous rules, which were done by opening a ticket to the support team. They will automatically update on the new screen.

## Main Advantages 
- Set the order authorization rules to approve or deny up to x% discount. In this way, you avoid losing orders that would not integrate due to the divergence of price.
- Increase your revenue.
- Create rules to approve or deny orders with prices changed manually, according to the store's business scenario.
- Have more independence on negotiations and add specific people to authorize orders that have had their prices modified manually.
