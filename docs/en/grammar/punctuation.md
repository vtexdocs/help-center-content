In a UI, the goal is to minimize distractions and guide users through clear actions and messages. The UI must be concise, functional, and often minimal in its use of punctuation.

Avoid using periods to end single sentences, particularly in labels, label description text, tooltip text, bulleted lists, dialog body text, hyperlinked text, titles, and buttons containing a sentence.

Use periods on long or complex sentences, paragraphs with multiple sentences, and any sentence followed by a link.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li>Invite your first seller</li><li>Here you can invite and onboard new sellers</li><li>Collection deleted successfully</li><li>Total captured orders within the selected period</li><li>Learn more</li><li>Delete user</li><li>I agree and accept</li></ul> | <ul><li>Invite your first seller.</li><li>Here you can invite and onboard new sellers.</li><li>Collection deleted successfully!</li><li>Total captured orders within the selected period.</li><li>Learn more.</li><li>Delete user?</li><li>I agree and accept.</li></ul> |

For a more objective message, avoid using commas.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li>[x] will also be removed from `{applications}` and other applications where it's being used</li><li>This collection has manually added products and also automatic filters in the CMS</li></ul> | <ul><li>If it's being used in `{applications}`, or others, it will also be removed from those applications</li><li>In addition to the manually added products, this collection has automatic filters in the CMS</li></ul> |

Use periods on multiple sentences; long or complex sentences, if it suits the context; or any sentence followed by a link.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |

| <ul><li>Words related to the product. They will be used in searches.
