A cross-border store is a type of [multistore](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-multi-store-multi-domain--tutorials_510?locale=en&_ga=2.139338803.1060780652.1642427010-1001456323.1619912759), which at VTEX means an account with multiple [bindings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-binding--4NcN3NJd0IeYccgWCI8O2W?&utm_source=autocomplete) and different sales channels for each one of its local stores.

Cross-border stores can reach shoppers worldwide by offering localized shopping experiences for your store's customers. 

If you want to reach customers worldwide and provide a localized shopping experience, please [open a ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk?_ga=2.193357418.672484859.1653422096-1001456323.1619912759) expressing your interest in becoming a cross-border store.

A cross-border store helps you:

- Promote business growth by selling products in global markets.
- Create an international reputation for the brand in the market.
- Choose local or trusted payment methods.
- Operate it under the same VTEX environment of a store name.

## Concepts

While setting up a cross-border store on the VTEX platform, it is important to understand some concepts: Multistore, Bindings, and Trade policies.

### Multistore
A multistore or multidomain is a second store administered within the same VTEX Admin panel. This feature is typically used when the store requires some specific environment (e.g., support for B2B sales) or when a store has multiple brands with similar logistics and payment methods.

### Binding

Binding is the process of linking a website to one of the stores available in your account. 
Creating a binding for your account is one of the steps in setting up a custom store website for a specific country or other target audience.

### Trade policy
A trade policy defines the content to be displayed on a website.
Trade policies contain settings regarding catalog, prices, promotions, logistics, customer segmentation, and payments for different sales strategies.

### Multi-language stores
Since a cross-border store can have multiple bindings and reach shoppers worldwide, it is important to provide website and catalog content internationalization for a personalized shopping experience. To internationalize your store content, please contact your developer team and refer to the [Internationalization](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-multi-language-stores) and [Translating Catalog content](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/catalog-internationalization) documentation.
