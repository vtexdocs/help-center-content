Stores developed with Store Framework are integrated with [Site Editor](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/working-with-site-editor), which works as a Content Management System (CMS). Other features like Page, Style, and Banner management are also available.

To build and configure your Store Framework website using CMS, you will use the following:

- [Site Editor](#site-editor)
- [Layout - Sites and channels](#layout-sites-and-channels)
- [Banners](#banners)
- [Pages](#pages)
- [Styles](#styles)
- [Media](#midia)

## Site Editor

**[Site Editor](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/site-editor-overview--299Dbeb9mFczUTyNQ9xPe1)** is a graphical interface for managing storefront content. It allows you to create, edit, publish, and schedule storefront components and behavior changes.

With an intuitive interface in the VTEX Admin, Site Editor reflects the blocks defined in the [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme), allowing anyone to make store content and layout changes without having to edit the code.

## Layout - Sites and channels

Stores developed using Store Framework must also configure the [store binding](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-cms-layout--EmO8u2WBj2W4MUQCS8262#binding) via the **[Sites and channels](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/o-que-e-o-cms-layout--EmO8u2WBj2W4MUQCS8262#sites-and-channels)** folder in the **Layout** section of the VTEX Admin.

Binding is the process of linking your website to a store. For more details, see the article [Linking a store to a folder structure in CMS (binding)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vincular-um-account-name-a-um-website-binding).

> ℹ️ Except the **Sites and channels**folder, all the other features in the **Layout** section of the VTEX Admin are only available for CMS Portal Legado stores.

## Banners

Banners is the feature that displays banners, like promotional campaigns, on the customer search results page. This is done by associating the words and filters selected in the search with the banner settings in your store.

To learn how to use this module, see the tutorial [Banners](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/banners--51nNoJABZ5NtvJQCucCXCy).

## Pages

The **Pages** module is where your site pages are managed. In the VTEX Admin, the pages are divided into **Default**, **Product**, **Product Collections**, and **Not Found (404)**. They allow you to create new URLs and link them to a template already defined in the [store theme code](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-4-configuringtemplates).

This section also includes the **Redirects** page that allows you to set up redirects from one store URL to a more relevant one.

## Styles

> ⚠️ This feature only works in [production workspaces](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-production-workspace).

To learn how to use this module, see the tutorial [Styles - Overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estilos-visao-geral--v0Db5ohEKSFIkTzSwCjVi).
