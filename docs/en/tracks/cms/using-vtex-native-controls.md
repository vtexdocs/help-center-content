Controls are snippets of codes that you can use in your website's templates to perform specific actions.

At VTEX, you will find a number of native controls to render various functionalities.

For example, if you use the `<vtex.cmc:productName/>` control on a product page, the system will provide the product name to be displayed on the screen.

To add a control, just paste it into the code. The result will be rendered at the position of the code where it is added.
