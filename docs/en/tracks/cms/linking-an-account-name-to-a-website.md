One of the first things you need to do on your _website_ is to link it to an _account name_. This process is called **binding**.

**Website binding** is the mechanism that bridges the gap between **CMS (Portal)** and the information defined in **License Manager**, to a specific _account name_.
To learn more about the relationship between License Manager and CMS, and how the pages of your store's website relate to your account, see our [article on binding](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-binding--4NcN3NJd0IeYccgWCI8O2W).
