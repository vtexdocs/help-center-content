VTEX Support is provided online and allows you to open tickets with different priority levels, depending on your store location. Tickets can be opened on the [support page](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support), which requires [user account authentication](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4EPwTXx5oFdSG1dA3zIchz#setting-roles-and-permissions-for-users). Three authentication methods are available:

- Token received via the email added to the store.
- Login using a Google account.
- Email and password with two-factor authentication via app or SMS.

> ⚠️ To get authentication authorization, the [user](/en/docs/tutorials/managing-admin-users) must have access to the VTEX Admin and a [role ](/en/docs/tutorials/roles) associated with [License Manager resources. ](/en/docs/tutorials/license-manager-resources).

VTEX Support operates globally and follows a standardized service model with unified criteria for availability, priority, and service level (SLA), applicable to all customers served by VTEX.
