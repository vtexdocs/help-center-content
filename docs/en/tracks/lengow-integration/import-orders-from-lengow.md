If you use the Lengow connector to sell on Amazon and eBay, you will need an additional step to import orders from Lengow into VTEX.

*If you need to integrate orders from marketplaces other than Amazon and eBay, please reach out to VTEX support team*.

### Manual import

To import orders manually, click on the **Import Orders** button seen in *Marketplace > Lengow Integration > Settings*. You can check the Logs and Statistics tabs to see if the importing process was run successfully.

### Automatic import

To import orders automatically, use any scheduling service to perform a periodic HTTP GET request to the following URL:

<div><span style="font-family: Monospace; font-size: 14px">http://<span style="color: #F71963">{accountName}</span>.myvtex.com/integration/lengow/importorders</span></div>

The image below provides an example of what that would look like in [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com/):
