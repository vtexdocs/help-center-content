Since 2009, [Lengow](https://www.lengow.com/) has grown in the European market by helping companies explore their opportunities for international growth with 1,600 sales channels in 42 different countries. The Lengow platform allows global brands to centralize, optimize and track the distribution of their product catalog on marketplaces, comparison websites, affiliate networks and retargeting campaigns.

The [Lengow connector](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-lengow/p) for VTEX allows your store to use their e-commerce feed management solution to increase the visibility and profitability of your products on Amazon, Google Shopping, Facebook, eBay, Criteo and <a href="https://www.lengow.com/marketplace-finder/" target="_blank">others</a>.

Once the connector app is set up, your catalog feed will become available in Lengow and your products will be ready to be published on the channels of your choice. As you sell across different channels, orders and product stock levels will be automatically kept in sync between VTEX and Lengow.

>⚠️ Importing orders from Lengow is currently only supported for Amazon and Ebay. This is because each marketplace has a different structure and order flow, so it is not possible to do a standard integration for all marketplaces. If you need to integrate orders from marketplaces other than Amazon and eBay, please reach out to the VTEX support team.

Before you start, you should already have signed up for a Lengow account. If you don't have one yet, you can [sign up for a free trial](https://my.lengow.io/registration) or [request a demo](https://www.lengow.com/ask-for-a-demo/) on their website to test their platform.
