The **Orders** module offers a number of different filters to make it easy to query and specify searches according to desired criteria.

To use the filter, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Orders > All Orders**, or type **All Orders** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click `Filters`.
3. Select the desired [filter](/en/docs/tutorials/filtering-all-orders).
4. Click `Apply`.

For more information about filters, see the article [Filtering orders on All Orders](/en/docs/tutorials/filtering-all-orders).

> ℹ️ When applying multiple filters to different searches, the total number of orders viewed in the filtering window may differ from the total displayed on the **All Orders** page due to a platform limitation. However, that does not impact the validity of the results displayed after filtering.
