There are different ways to add a product:

- VTEX Admin
- Importing spreadsheet
- API

> ℹ️ Before creating a product, you must have created and activated its corresponding brand and category.

> ⚠️ If your product does not appear on your store's website after you have created it, check out the article [Why is the product not shown on the website?](/en/faq/why-is-the-product-not-visible-on-the-website) to understand how to solve this problem.

## VTEX Admin

To add a new product to the store catalog, check the article [Adding or editing products](/en/docs/tutorials/adding-or-editing-products).

## Spreadsheet

We recommend that you add products and SKUs together when using a spreadsheet. You can check out the steps on the [Adding SKU](/en/docs/tracks/adding-skus) article of this track.

## API

To add a new product via API use the [Create product with category and brand](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/product) endpoint. 

> ℹ️ If you want to import products via [backend integrations](/en/docs/tracks/backend-integrations) with an ERP, check out the [Back office integration guide (ERP/PIM/WMS)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-guide).
