To organize the permissions of users who have access to the VTEX store administrative environment, the platform works with **roles**.

Roles define which resources the user can view and/or change within each module of the platform. Each profile gives permission to access different areas and resources of the Admin.

You can create new profiles and set permissions for them. Or you can use the [predefined profiles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/access-profiles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#description-of-predefined-profiles), which are configured on the platform by default. Predefined profiles usually meet the vast majority of needs across all stores.

> ‚ùó Poor management of your store's roles can have serious consequences for your business. See best practices in the article: [Security measures for creating a store's user profiles](https://help.vtex.com/faq/security-measures-for-creating-a-store-user-profiles--15YDwC9jGgqWi3rvcDaiGM).
