Inventory is the feature for managing products available for sale. Once [products have been added](/en/docs/tutorials/adding-or-editing-products) to the [catalog](/en/docs/tracks/catalog-concept-definition), they must be listed in a warehouse to become available for sale. The [Inventory management](/en/docs/tutorials/managing-stock-items) module is where catalog items are associated with a warehouse.

> ℹ️ Remember to add at least one [warehouse](/en/docs/tutorials/warehouse) in your store before using the [Inventory](/en/docs/tutorials/managing-stock-items).

In the inventory, retailers can see:

* Item availability
* The warehouse in which the item is stored
* Item update history
* [Reserved](/en/docs/tutorials/how-does-reservation-work) items

To add items in bulk to the inventory, use the inventory template to import them. Learn more in the article [Importing and exporting an inventory spreadsheet](/en/docs/tutorials/importing-and-exporting-an-inventory-spreadsheet).

Use the [critical inventory level alert](/en/docs/tutorials/setting-up-the-critical-stock-alert) to receive notifications when an item is almost out of stock.

> ℹ️ You can also set up your inventory via the [ Inventory API.](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/inventory)
