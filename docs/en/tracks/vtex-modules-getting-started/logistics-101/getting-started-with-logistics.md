The **Inventory & shipping** module is where you set up the logistics of your VTEX store. In this module, you can manage your store's inventory, shipping rates, item availability, and deliveries. You must configure this module according to your business strategy, since the features available in it are directly related to the end-customer experience.

This article is the first in a series of five articles for getting started with logistics in your store. The series contains essential information to help you understand logistics in VTEX stores and how settings are structured on the platform.
