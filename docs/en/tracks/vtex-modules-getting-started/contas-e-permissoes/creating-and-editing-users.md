You can also register and manage __users__ through the Account Management module in Admin.

This is where we register the users that can access the administrative environment of the store. Here we can also manage which actions each user is allowed to perform in the store.

## Creating Users

1. In the Account Management module, click on the **Users** tab.
2. Click on the **New User** button.
3. Enter the **Email** and **Full name**.
4. Add or create the [roles](/en/tutorial/gerenciando-usuarios--tutorials_512) you want.
5. Click on the **Save** button.

The user will receive an email confirming the registration, with a link to create a password.

The password must be at least eight characters long and include a number, a capital letter and a lowercase letter.

After entering this password, an access key will be sent by email to validate the registration.

## Editing User

1. In the Account Management module, click on the **Users** tab.
2. Select the desired user and click on their name (or on the editing icon in the Actions column).
3. Edit the data on the editing page.

You cannot change the email. To do this, it is necessary to make a new registration.

## Deleting User

1. In the Account Management module, click on the **Users** tab.
2. Select the desired user and click on the **trash can** icon in the Actions column.
3. Click on **confirm**.

> ℹ️ Although integration tokens de integração are listed as users, they cannot be excluded. To disable them, navigate to *Account settings > Account management > Account* in your Admin panel and uncheck the **Token Status** field.
