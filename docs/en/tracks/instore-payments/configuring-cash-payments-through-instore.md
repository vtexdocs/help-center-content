This article explains how to configure VTEX Sales App to accept cash payments.
This configuration is done in two steps:

Before configuring the cash payment display in VTEX Sales App, you must [create a custom payment](#creating-a-custom-payment) and a [payment condition](#creating-a-payment-condition) for it. Both actions must be performed in the VTEX admin panel.

## Creating a custom payment

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payments** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Go to the **Custom payments** tab.
3. In the **Notes payable** section, click on any of the boxes containing <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> `Config`.
4. In the **Name** field, type the name you want to use for this custom payment. For example, "Cash".
5. In the **Automatic authorization** field, select **Yes**. The other fields do not need to be filled in or changed.
6. Click on `Save`.

## Creating a payment condition

Now we will create the payment condition.

1. Still on the **Settings** page of the **Payments** module in the VTEX Admin, click on the **Payment conditions** tab.
2. Click on the green button with the `+` icon to add a new condition, as shown below.

3. In the **Custom payment** section, select the **Cash** option you have created.
4. Enter a name for this payment condition, change the status to **Active**, and in the **Process with affiliation** field, select the custom payment you created in the previous step.
5. Click on `Save`.
