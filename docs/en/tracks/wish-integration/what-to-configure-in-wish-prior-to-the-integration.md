>⚠️ Presently, the Wish app is only available to Brazilian stores.

You'll need to prepare your Wish environment before starting the integration with VTEX. The main steps are as follows:

1. [Create your Wish account](https://merchant.wish.com/open?referral_id=5dbf5f2839622963f0da94ff); 
2. Set up Brazil as the country you're shipping from;
3. Choose your shipping method. Wish has two available options: 
- **Standard or default**: this options has a single fixed shipping price country-wide for Brazil and no estimated delivery date.
- **Wish Express**: fast delivery option that allows _sellers_ (retailers) to enable a price per product for 12 sub-regions in the country. The shipping time is **10** business days.
4. If you choose [Wish Express](https://merchantfaq.wish.com/hc/pt/articles/360018939394-Como-enviar-usando-o-Wish-Express-Brasil-):
