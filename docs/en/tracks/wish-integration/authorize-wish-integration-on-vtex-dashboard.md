To begin synchronizing data with Wish, you'll need to authorize VTEX's integration to perform actions in your Wish environment account.

To grant the authorization, follow the steps below:

1. In the admin menu's installed apps section, click on Wish;
2. On the app's main screen, click on authorize integration;
3. You will be redirected to Wish's environment. Log into your Wish account. If you're already logged in, the terms and conditions will automatically be displayed, requiring your approval;
4. Click on accept;
5. You will be once again redirected to the app on the VTEX dashboard.

During the next step, we will take a look at how to configure the app!
