In order for physical store salespeople to meet the customers needs and make sales, first of all, they need to be able to identify those customers.

By default, inStore offers four different methods of identifying customers:
- Email
- CPF (for Brazil)
- Telephone
- QR Code

To choose which identification methods you want to enable, access the VTEX administrative panel and, in the main menu, click on __Instore__ and then on __Customer Identification__.

In the __Customer's login__ box, you must select the identification methods you want to enable.

You can also change the order of these methods. To do this, just drag them, as shown in the image below. The order of the methods defined on this screen determines the order in which they will appear to the salespeople in the app. Therefore, the first method will be the default.

## Enabling Anonymous User

It is possible to use the inStore to cater customers anonymously, that is, without identifying them.

For this, still in the Customer Identification screen, you need to enable the __Anonymous user__ flag.

![21. Configure client identification - 3 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3MpFYKg99z1oW1w0ZPzCbN/2d6da3c24fa44ec72ed3cb385c49f96c/21._Configure_client_identification_-_3_-_EN.png_h_250)

## Legal Entity Registration for B2B sales

The Customer Identification screen also allows the identification of Legal Entity fields. That is, in addition to the Individual form, this feature allows the display of a form for B2B sales.

To do this, activate the flag in the __Legal entity registration__ box.

You can then choose whether these fields are mandatory or optional.

In the example below, the Legal Entity registration is activated and configured as optional.

![21. Configure client identification - 4 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2bf1NMJMXF9JHnM67mFI2s/2c342420c8705dd137048a6ac6edee17/21._Configure_client_identification_-_4_-_EN.png_h_250)

In this case, the application will show the salespeople a form like the one below:

![21. Configure client identification - 5.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1wjA3eb0wgoeVsnq3Bgl17/47968bd2948a339e964f5057b251b5f1/21._Configure_client_identification_-_5.png_h_250)

Note that a flag is displayed that allows the salesperson to decide whether to show these additional fields or not. This is because, in the settings, we marked the legal entity registration fields as optional. If they are marked as mandatory, this flag will not show on the app.
