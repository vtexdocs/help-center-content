After creating your Google Merchant Center account, define the [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) that you are going to use. When you [configure a trade policy for a marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-a-politica-comercial-para-marketplace/), you determine which products will be submitted to Google Shopping and their price on the platform.

In most cases, we recommend choosing the main trade policy (ID: 1), as Google Shopping results direct buyers to purchase from advertisersâ€™ stores. Therefore, the integration will submit all the products available in your store to Google at the same advertised prices.

You will need to request the creation of a new trade policy only if you want to: 
- Offer a different product assortment on Google Shopping.
- Sell products at different prices on Google Shopping.

To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), please open a ticket to our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) by selecting Commercial and Create a trade policy.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), [certified connectors (partners)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-connector-partner), or other VTEX stores is free of charge.
