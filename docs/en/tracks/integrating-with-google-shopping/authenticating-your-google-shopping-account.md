After configuring the integration, you must authenticate your Google Shopping account on VTEX. Please follow the instructions below:

1. Access the Admin.
2. In the Marketplace module, click on `Integrations`.
3. Select `Settings`.
4. In the Google Shopping integration, click on the gear icon <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>.
5. Select the `Authorization` option.
6. Click on the `Authenticate my account` button.
7. Click `OK` to authorize the VTEX integration to connect with the ID Business Manager profile.

>ℹ️ There may be a delay between completing the integration and the moment it goes live because the update is not synchronous.  But it takes no more than a few hours.
