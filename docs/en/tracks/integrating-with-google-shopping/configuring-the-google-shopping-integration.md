Check out how to integrate your store with Google Shopping using the connector developed by VTEX. It should be your standard choice, as it provides more efficiency and security.

>‚ùó The integration can be performed via [XML](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-xml--tutorials_242) . We do not recommend integrating with [Google Shopping using an XML file](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-configurar-xml-do-google-shopping--frequentlyAskedQuestions_372) and the native connector simultaneously, because this might lead to conflicting information and data discrepancy.

To integrate using the connector, **you must have a Google Merchant Center account.**  If you don't have one, check out the tutorial [sign up for Google Merchant Center](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188924?hl=en&ref_topic=7294166).

These are the next steps to integrate your VTEX store with Google Shopping:

1. [Define the trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/integrating-with-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/3AqbcsWrge8zLt0BC5CtGd)
2. [Configure the connector](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/integrating-with-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/wWyl0Njxgs5KfXvxYZJrl)
3. [Authenticate your account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/integrating-with-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/44hAYlKYSRZMTNY3ELxeQ2)
4. [Submit products to Google Shopping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/integrating-with-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/5L5LnccDCj5lJk8H95GQ82)
