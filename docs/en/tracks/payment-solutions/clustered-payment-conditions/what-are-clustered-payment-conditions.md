Clustered Payments Conditions are a new [Customer Credit](/en/announcements/de-credito-aos-seus-melhores-clientes-com-o-customer-credit--6M2V1Oc1UIaGSM6QayWkmq?&utm_source=autocomplete) feature that allows stores to set a given deadline and enact an installment rule that will be valid for one or more customers of their trust. This filter is made using clusters - a segmentation method.

> ℹ️ This functionality is currently in Closed Beta (testing stage) and is not available for installation in new stores.  

This customization is done using our [Master Data](/en/docs/tutorials/master-data) database.
