After setting up the logistics and registering the inventory, you need to register the prices of your products inside inStore's sales policy.

If inStore products should have the same price as the e-commerce sales policy, no action is required. The product's base price will apply to all sales policies.

If you want to create a pricing rule specific to the inStore sales policy, follow the steps below:

- Enter the __Pricing__ module.
- In the top menu, click __Price Rules__.
- Click __New Rule__.
- In the __Trade policy__ field, choose the inStore policy.
- Choose whether the rule will be applied to __all products__ of this policy or __only in categories and brands chosen__.
- Choose whether the rule will be applied to items in a specific __markup range__.
- Choose whether the rule will apply to any specific __period__.
- Finally, choose what will be the price variation of this rule in relation to the base price of the products.
- Click __Save__.
