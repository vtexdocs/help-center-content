This article aims to demonstrate the steps in the inStore usage journey, once installed and configured, and to point out the app's main features.

Here you can see the behavior of the application at each stage of interaction with the salesperson. Some of the steps described are optional (such as cart capture), but they represent the core set of inStore functionality.

## 1. Login

The first contact between the the physical store salesperson and inStore happens when logging into the application.

Here, the e-mail and password created for the salesperson in the [Basic Setup](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc) must be used. Remember that you cannot use emails that already have access to the administrative panel of VTEX stores.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 1 - EN.png?h=250](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/35HU0Wz5eJp53X7JSebBgx/608f3fa8cef774bee9106a997de71567/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_1_-_EN.png_h_250)

Upon logging in, the salesperson accesses the inStore application specific to a VTEX account. Although it is not a common scenario, the same salesperson may be linked to more than one account. If you need to switch accounts, just log out and, on the login screen, click on __Change Store__.

Also remember that if the seller does not yet have credentials to log in, they must contact the account administrators.

## 2. Customer identification

After logging in, the salesperson is taken directly to the customer identification screen.

InStore is an app that helps salespeople to make sales in the physical store. And having information about the customer since the initial interaction is a valuable resource to accomplish that goal, especially considering that the context shown by inStore concerns not only the customer's interactions with that specific store, but with all the brand's sales channels.

The customer can be identified by one of these methods:
- Email
- CPF (in Brazil)
- Telephone
- QR Code

You can [configure which identification methods you want to enable](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-customizations--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/3AU7dicoaj3OVaprS6Wh2W), and in what order they should appear.

In the example image below, E-mail and CPF are enabled.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 2 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2YKc9S2FehS7eA2zTskL33/f15d5d5556b31f7ce78eb3d77994c722/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_2_-_EN.png_h_250)

Just enter one of these data in the field and click on the __Confirm__ button.

Alternatively, if you have enabled the Anonymous User feature, it is possible to proceed without identifying the customer. To do this, just click on __Continue without identification__.

>ℹ️ Although it is possible to cater customers without identifying them, we always recommend doing so, as this gives the salesperson a series of contextual information that increases the chances of conversion.

## 3. Omnichannel search

The top bar of the inStore app offers some options frequently used by the salesperson. One of them is the SKU search, available in the upper right corner.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 3 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5zBP54Dt2s7P6514vC1K8z/f0680a6383e525a329089eb247501d4d/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_3_-_EN.png_h_250)

In inStore the search is omnichannel. That is, when doing a search in the app, the salesperson is searching both in the local inventory (of the physical store itself) and in the catalog of other physical stores and the e-commerce.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 4 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5jBZMQOVW1n0ObtiwMYDtV/37bc53a81fea4d2db3cc61e5ccc0dd51/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_4_-_EN.png_h_250)

The delivery and pickup availability options will be shown later, in the delivery stage.

## 4. Barcode reading

After identifying the customer, the salesperson is taken directly to the cart. There, if you are using the desktop version of inStore, connected to a barcode reader, simply beep the products and they will appear in the cart.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 5 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5QbuILII93SyE4j7ovXed5/0390993518b96fb07f68c19345470413/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_5_-_EN.png_h_250)

If the salesperson is using a tablet or smartphone, they will see a barcode reading button on the top bar of the application.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 6 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4yAzpm3JHk9Ksjku7FbVcO/b1b41cfb9a3cfb9266383011e793c175/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_6_-_EN.png_h_250)

When clicking on it, the salesperson can use the camera to beep a product and, with that, be automatically taken to the details screen of that product.

## 5. Omnichannel cart

Since consulting the catalog makes inStore bring products not only from the local inventory but from the entire catalog shared between channels, the cart assembled with inStore is omnichannel: it can contain products that exist in the store's local warehouse, but also others that exist in other warehouses.

It's as if the salesperson had access to the e-commerce checkout but also with access to the physical store's inventories. The inStore checkout brings the same data you would have in e-commerce to the order context in the physical store:
- Catalog SKU data
- Promotions and gift cards from the promotions module
- Fulfillment prices and SLAs
- Payments module installments
- Logistics module delivery SLAs
- Fees

## 6. Access to the customer's last cart

After the salesperson identifies the customer, inStore searches for information about that customer that can assist in the sale. One of this information shows the last cart assembled but left open by that customer.

When having access to this information, the salesperson can try to complete the sale of the items that were in that cart, that is, they can try to recover the abandoned cart.

They just need to click __Access__ to see the products in the abandoned cart.

## 7. Customer profile

In the cart, the salesperson can click on __Order Summary__ and then on the customer's name. This gives them access to relevant customer information for the sale:
- Number of days since the customer's last visit to a store or e-commerce (considering, of course, that they were identified on that visit)
- Customer data, such as email, phone and document number
- Customer addresses
- Last cart created by the customer in the e-commerce
- Order history

In the box showing the last cart, the salesperson can retrieve that cart with just one click on the button __Recover Cart__.

In the boxes of each of the last orders placed by the customer, the salesperson can copy the cart, also pressing a single button: __Copy Cart__.

Remember that all this information refers not only to the customer's experience in the current physical store, but also to that customer's interactions in the e-commerce or in any physical store where a salesperson has catered the customer with an inStore app.

## 8. Product details

When clicking on the details of a product that appears in the inStore search results, or when beeping a product, the salesperson is directed to the product details screen.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 7 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/fSLOfLn7bnpFyAfujZ8GN/52e0133e7222676d105e4444ce83ea96/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_7_-_EN.png_h_250)

This screen shows the name of the product, its photo gallery, variations, description and availability. On this screen, the salesperson can add the product to the cart.

Note that if you have configured your store to [force stock availability](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-customizations--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/2SgRUekV8FO4lg2aO6YTmh), even if the product is unavailable in all channels, the salesperson will be able to add it to the cart.

## 9. Product recommendations

Both in the product details and in the cart, inStore shows product recommendations by default. These suggestions are made according to the characteristics of the product that is currently being viewed or the items that make up the cart.

It is possible to disable product recommendations. For this, check out the article [Enabling product recommendation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-customizations--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/321NRjb9YjABQPReJJ5wr2).

## 10. Cart transfer

InStore let's you [enable a cart transfer functionality](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-customizations--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/1PqUW2NuQzaVxTJp0lBK0r). This functionality allows a purchase initiated on one device to be completed on any other device present in the purchase flow, without the need to re-beep the products.

Once in an order cart, the salesperson has access to the __Transfer__ button. When clicking this button, the app shows a QR Code and a four-digit numeric code.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 8 - EN.png?h=250](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4DIaRH9gE7NVSsFMQINg4x/2531727e3528f275e02919c9939c5c09/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_8_-_EN.png_h_250)

Another salesperson logged into the same store can then capture that cart and continue selling from their device.

To capture a cart, enter the inStore main menu and click on __Capture Cart__. Alternatively, on the app's home screen, the salesperson can slide the screen to the right.

They should then enter the numeric code shown on the device of the salesperson who transferred the cart or click on __Read QR Code__ and then use the camera on their device to read the QR Code generated on the device of the first salesperson.

Once this is done, the cart will be transferred to the second device, from where the sale can proceed normally.

## 11. Delivery

When the salesperson clicks __Go to delivery__, inStore shows the customer's available addresses. That is, if the customer has at any time registered more than one delivery address, all address options already informed will show here.
Alternatively, the salesperson can enter a zip code.

The next screen shows the delivery options. As inStore deals with the catalog of multiple stores, there are several possibilities for organizing delivery, depending on where the products in the cart are.

The example below shows two options: receive all items at home or pick up at another physical store within 5 working days.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 10](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/621Dlpel880kPOoL8Ur6id/476f54c1dba26c76fc90a691f33baa0c/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_10.png)

### Pick-up Points

For pick-up point options, the system selects the stores that have the SKUs in stock and shows the store closest to the customer's zip code, as a suggestion. If the salesperson wants to change the store where the customer will pick up the items, they just need to click the __Change pick-up point__ button.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 11](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2lmJceEfryZV6OBtgGc3Tq/167a7c3f169dab3ffbf49c30d670702e/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_11.png)

When choosing to change the pick-up point, the salesperson first has access to the pick-up point suggested by the system. To see all available pick-up points, click __View all pick-up points__.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 12](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1ZUGWgHe2jI2ROLpIZ1HnN/e6a59ee600f6ae05a2d3e2a27cc8501e/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_12.png)

The app will then show the list of pick-up points ordered by the shortest distance from the customer's zip code. It's also possible to choose a pick-up point on the map.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 13](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/uT46sKKgmyT4Lmh8usLO3/3aa559f183e4d5dda3254844aac2fd19/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_13.png)

## 12. Payment

In the payment step, the salesperson will see the [payment options that have been configured](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-payments--43B4Nr7uZva5UdwWEt3PEy) for your store.

An important feature allowed by inStore is multiple payments. For example, by choosing Cash and then clicking __Add another payment__, the salesperson can charge part of the amount in cash and part on credit or debit card.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 14](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1Kka7eQvf03YXWR5DA2NEJ/6701ce986792dce02f88bfc4a18c0d9d/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_14.png)

The top bar of the payment screen allows you to add a coupon and a gift card. It also allows changing the customer ID number that will appear on the invoice.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 15](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3CymGlJlWQ9I9w5tiheXQk/577fb68901d2e0a8b17ae11fb55ed98f/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_15.png)

## 13. Order placed

The salesperson can see this same screen by clicking on __Completed Orders__ in inStore's main menu or searching for the order by order number or customer.

![31. inStore - Product Overview - 16](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1WzildtkElOIkalZuY3hkI/3bda7ef00a309b1e57081ad805adb889/31._inStore_-_Product_Overview_-_16.png)

## 14. NFC-e printing

Using inStore, you can sell products from your physical store by receiving payments with the card machine and immediately generating the invoice.

If the printing device was [configured correctly](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/12GPLA7JdjXEZFLV3HokZU), the invoice will be printed automatically as soon as the order is completed.

## 15. Print order summary

In addition to the invoice, it's possible to print a summary of the order when the sale is completed.

You can [configure inStore to print the order summary automatically](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/12GPLA7JdjXEZFLV3HokZU), once the order is placed. But, by default, it doesn't.

However, if the salesperson still wants to print the order summary, just click the __Print Order__ button on the placed order screen, as long as the printing device is correctly configured to print orders.
