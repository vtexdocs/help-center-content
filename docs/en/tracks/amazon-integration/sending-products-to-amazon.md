Once the initial integration settings have been configured, you must send your products to the Amazon catalog. To enable the product cataloging process and make them available for sale on Amazon, add products in the VTEX Admin using [Amazon Listing](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/amazon-listing--5HIhbnYzJWkl2yM0o72WrL).

<div class= "alert info">
All products must have a <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estoque--6oIxvsVDTtGpO7y6zwhGpb">Warehouse</a>  and a <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP">Price</a> configured before being sent to the marketplace.
</div>

To add your store products, you must configure the [EAN field](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/campos-de-cadastro-de-produto--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke) for the products you want to send to Amazon.  

## EAN

The Amazon catalog requires that products sent have an EAN, so that they can group products from all sellers. Therefore, make sure your products have valid EANs before setting up the integration.  

However, there are situations where [Amazon exempts the merchant from sending the EAN](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200426310). In this case, the exemption must be configured directly on Amazon.
