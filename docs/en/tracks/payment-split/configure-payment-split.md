Currently, the payment split option is only supported by two acquirers:

- VTEX Payment
- [PagarMeV2][1]

Find out how to configure the payment split option for each of these below.

## Split configuration for PagarMe

Follow these steps:

1. Access the __Admin__.
2. Click on the __Payment__ module.
3. Then, click on __Settings__.
4. On the top of the page, go to the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab.
5. Click on the __"+" green button__.
6. In the __Others__ section, select the __PagarMeV2__ option. 
7. On the left side, fill in the __Affiliation Name field__.
8. Fill the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with the information provided by PagarMe
9.  In Auto Settlement, select one of the options below:
 - **Use Payment Processor Recommended Behavior**: - Payment capture is not automatic but rather scheduled according to the connector’s specific delay. In addition to confirming if the payment was authorized, the payment provider may designate or recommend a timeframe for the payment capture to take place once the Gateway authorizes the payment - this being the platform’s default behavior.
- **Immediately: Auto Settle Upon Payment Authorization**: payment capture is automatic and occurs right after payment authorization even if the transaction has an ongoing anti-fraud analysis.
- **Immediately: Auto Settle Once Risk Analysis Has Been Approved**: payment capture is automatic and takes place right after payment authorization and anti-fraud analysis (if you select this behavior and do not have an anti-fraud analysis option enabled, the payment capture will occur as it does when the **Immediately: Auto Capture Upon Payment Authorization**) behavior is selected.
- **Disabled: Do Not Auto Settle**: capture does not happen automatically.
10. In __Enable split and send recipients?__, select the option __Yes__. 
11. In __Responsibility for payment fees__, select which __payment processor__ will pay the fees.
12. In __Responsibility for chargebacks__, select which __payment processor__ will pay the chargeback. 
13. Click on the __Save button__.
