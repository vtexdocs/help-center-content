This stage initiates the go-live as these steps need to be carefully scheduled based on the expected go-live date.

## Registering the domain on VTEX

To connect the domain to the store, you must [register the domain in Account Management](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-dominios-no-license-manager).

>⚠️ After registering your domain, you have seven days to complete the go-live. Otherwise, you must go back to the registration and save it again.

## Requesting IO pointing

If your storefront is powered by [CMS IO](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2), please submit a ticket to [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) requesting internal DNS pointing to CMS IO and provide the URL you want to be pointed. This process can take up to 3 business days.

After you receive the internal pointing confirmation, you must do the [common DNS pointing](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/go-live-your-store--4Ns5FxIiksmjsdX2yOTduM/12bQlMbJ68Ot0LIaO6Btkj#setting-up-dns-pointing) within 5 days. Otherwise the internal pointing will be deleted and you will need to redo the request.

## Requesting special pointing

If your store access is limited by a [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) with a conditional rule and your storefront was built with the [Legacy CMS Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj), you will need to request a special internal pointing.

An example is [B2B stores](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/b2b-visao-geral--5vb9SNXhX2bZnkpAh7ADdC), which [restrict access](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-b2b-na-vtex--tutorials_238) to pre-approved companies.

To request a special pointing, open a ticket with [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support), indicating which trade policy and conditional rule are configured. This process can take up to 3 business days.

After receiving the internal pointing confirmation, you must set up the [regular DNS pointing](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/go-live-your-store--4Ns5FxIiksmjsdX2yOTduM/12bQlMbJ68Ot0LIaO6Btkj#setting-up-dns-pointing) within five days. Otherwise, the special DNS pointing will be deleted, and you will need to redo this request.
