The Extensions Hub is an Admin section that groups all extension information and resources. Extensions are tools that expand the features of the VTEX platform, including VTEX IO apps, payment connectors, and marketplace integrations.

To access the Extensions Hub, go to the left-side menu in the Admin and click the **Extensions** icon at the top.

You can find three pages in the Extensions Hub section: **App Store**, **App Management**, and **Partners**. Documentation on each of these pages can be found in the articles below.
