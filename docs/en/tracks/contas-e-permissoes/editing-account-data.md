In the **Account Management** section of the Admin side menu you will find the **Accounts** option. There you can edit the general data of your account.

See below what these data are.

## Active/Inactive button

When you disable this button, the store bcomes inaccessible to end users.

## "In production" button

By default, the store's initial status is out of production. In this status, there is no traffic to the store yet.

Under the standard VTEX contract, no percentage is charged on sales while the store is not in production.

## Company data

Here, you can edit the following company data:

- Account name (the identifier name of your account, used in the Admin access URL. It cannot be changed).
- Trading name
- Company name
- Tax Id

## Store

At VTEX, each account can have more than one store. And each of these stores can have a specific CSS file structure linked to it, meaning that each store can have a different front-end.

In addition, you can differentiate catalog, price and logistics in each of these stores by using commercial policies.

These stores are created here, in the Account Management section. Click on **Add new host** and fill in the information.

## Safety

The appKeys and appTokens used to authenticate integrations with your store are created here.

Only the Sponsor user is allowed to create appKeys and appTokens, since they give access to your store via API, which can be critical if not used by skilled professionals.

## Contact

The data included in the contact area are from the store Sponsor user.

So here is where you define who is the user with the highest permission level in your store.
