As seen in the previous topic, every VTEX account is by default created with a series of predefined roles.

However, you can edit these profiles or create new ones.

This may be necessary in case you need to define a structure of priority levels that does not exist by default in any predefined profile.

Let's see, then, how to do this.


## Creating Roles

To create a new role to your VTEX store, follow these steps:
- In the Account Management module, click on **Roles**.
- Click on the green button **New Profile**.
- Select a role type to use as a base (if you want to start from scratch, select the **Custom** option).
- Fill in the name of the new profile.
- In the **Choose a Product** field, select the suitable applications.
- Within the added applications, mark the resources to which this profile will have access.
- Once you have added products and resources, if you want you can add the emails of the users who will have this role.
- Click on the **Save** button.

This done, simply associate users with the new role.


## Editing Roles

Editing predefined roles is similar to creating profiles.

You simply have to click on the desired profile and configure new products, marking the resources to which the profile has access.

If you want to delete any products, click on the "x" in the upper right corner of that product's box.
