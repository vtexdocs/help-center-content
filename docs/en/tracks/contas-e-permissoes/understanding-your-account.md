After contracting with VTEX, every store gets an account that gives them access to the admin panel and allows them to manage important aspects of their ecommerce.

The admin panel can be accessed via browser by the following URL, where {accountName} should be replaced by the name of your account: `{accountName}.myvtex.com/admin`

Once you have accessed this URL and signed in, you will enter your store's unique administrative panel.

In the side menu on the left part of the screen you will find the **Account Management** section. This is the section responsible for managing three important parts of your ecommerce:
- Store users: the emails that have access to your admin panel.
- Roles:  the permission levels, which define which tasks each user can perform.
- General data of the account: global information of your business.
