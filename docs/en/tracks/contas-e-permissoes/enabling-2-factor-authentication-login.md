With two-step verification (also known as two-factor authentication or 2FA), you add an extra layer of security to your account to protect it if your password is revealed to a third party.

After enabling the 2FA, you will make your store login using:

- Your password (*something you know*)
- Your phone number (*something you own*)

Your phone will generate a short key at the moment of login. Thus, it becomes almost impossible that someone unauthorized accesses your store using your information.

## How to enable the 2FA

We always request the two-step verification setup, in case it is not enabled when users log in using their email and password.

There are two authentication options:

- __App Google__ (key generated by an authentication app)
- __SMS Message__ (key sent by text message)

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  We recommend you to use a<a href="#enabling-2fa-por-aplicativo">authentication application</a> to prevent failures in your telephone provider from making your login impossible. Though the app, the access key will always be available for use.

As some companies restrict the use of cell phones by telesales operators, users with the <a href="https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#call-center-operator"> telesales role</a> do not have to enable the 2FA when logging in with email and password.
</div>

## Enabling the 2FA through an app

To use a key generated by authentication application:

1. Download the application **Google Authenticator** ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) / [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=pt_BR)).

2. Use the application to read the QR Code with your phone's camera.

3. Your VTEX account will be added to the application, with a 6-digit code. Enter the code to finish your login.

  *The app code is regularly updated. It will not be necessary to memorize it, go to the application whenever you need it.*

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you log in using your email and password on the same computer, you will be asked for your access key every 3 days. When this happens, check the code in the application.
</div>.

## Enabling 2FA via SMS

To use a key sent by text message:

1. enter your phone number to receive the code by SMS - don't forget to enter your country and area code.

2. You will receive a text message from VTEX on the indicated phone. Enter the 6-digit key to finish your login.

 <div class="alert alert-warning">
We cannot guarantee that your telephone company will be able to deliver the access key whenever necessary. If the VTEX text message does not arrive, try resending the code or <a href="#enabling-2fa-through-an-app" >enable the 2FA per-application</a>.
</div>

## Change 2FA settings

To change the two-step verification settings:

1. Access your user settings by clicking on the circle with your initials in the top-right corner of the Admin.

3. You can then change your settings by following similar steps as those described in the sections above to enable 2FA via [SMS](#enabling-2fa-via-sms) and [application](#enable-o-2fa-by-application).
