After installing the app, you must configure it in the VTEX Admin. To do this, follow the steps in the next sections of this article.

1. [Completing the integration configuration form](#1-completing-the-integration-configuration-form).
2. [Connecting your TikTok account](#2-connecting-your-tiktok-account).
3. [Configuring TikTok for Business](#3-configuring-tiktok-for-business).

## 1. Completing the integration configuration form

First, you must fill in the TikTok integration configuration form with the requested information.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Marketplace > TikTok**. For some versions of the VTEX Admin, you can access the page in **Apps > My apps > TikTok**.
2. Complete the form with the information described in the following sections:
    * [Configuration of the catalog integration](#configuration-of-the-catalog-integration).
    * [Company data](#company-data).
    * [Contact information](#contact-information).
3. Click `Continue`.
4. Check the information displayed before proceeding.
5. Click `Confirm`.
   You will be directed to a screen to [connect to the TikTok account](#2-connecting-your-tiktok-account).

### Configuration of the catalog integration 

In this part of the form, you need to fill in information that will be used to integrate your product catalog with TikTok.

* **Affiliate ID:** the identifier of the [new affiliate](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-an-affiliate--4bN3e1YarSEammk2yOeMc0) you want to create for the integration. The affiliate ID must contain only 3 consonants and cannot be associated with an existing affiliate. We suggest using `TKT` to easily identify TikTok. It is important to check if the ID is not in use in **Orders management > Settings > Affiliates**. The affiliate will be created automatically when you complete the configuration. 

* **Trade policy:** a field to select the trade policy to be associated with a catalog integrated with TikTok. Currently, the integration only accepts trade policies with BRL as currency. See the [Sending product data to TikTok](#sending-product-data-to-tiktok) section for more information.

>⚠️ Do not change the affiliate configuration created automatically through this integration. Any future manual changes to the affiliate's configuration in **Orders management > Settings > Affiliates** may cause the integration to stop working.

### Company data

In this section, you must enter your store’s information, which will be sent to TikTok.

* **Store name:** the name of your store as it will appear on TikTok.
* **Store website:** URL of your store's website that will appear on TikTok. It cannot be changed later.
* **Segment:** a field to select the market segment in which the store operates, among the options made available by TikTok.
* **Country:** the country in which the store operates. Currently, the integration is only available for Latin American countries.
* **Time zone:** the time zone in which the business is located.

### Contact information

Here, you need to specify the contact details of the person responsible for the integration, so that TikTok can contact them if necessary.

* **Email:** the email of the person responsible for the integration. It does not have to be the email address of your VTEX Admin account, you can inform any contact email address.
* **Country code:** the country code for the phone number of the person responsible.
* **Phone:** the phone number of the person responsible.
