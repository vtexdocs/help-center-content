After the sales associate identifies the customer, VTEX Sales App searches for information about that customer that can assist in the sale. One of this information shows the last cart assembled but left open by that customer.

When having access to this information, the sales associate can try to complete the sale of the items that were in that cart, that is, they can try to recover the abandoned cart.

They just need to click `Access` to see the products in the abandoned cart.
