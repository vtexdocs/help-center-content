Both in the product details and in the cart, inStore shows product recommendations by default. These suggestions are made according to the characteristics of the product that is currently being viewed or the items that make up the cart.

It is possible to disable product recommendations. For this, check out the article [Enabling product recommendation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-customizations--1z9kBm12oBPyVNDo1ivVc2/321NRjb9YjABQPReJJ5wr2).
