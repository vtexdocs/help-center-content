Using inStore, you can sell products from your physical store by receiving payments with the card machine and immediately generating the invoice.

If the printing device was [configured correctly](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/12GPLA7JdjXEZFLV3HokZU), the invoice will be printed automatically as soon as the order is completed.
