A campaign is a resource for **creating target audiences**.

These target audiences are defined based on criteria chosen by the store and can be used to create campaign-type promotions. A promotion of this kind will only be applied to the target audience defined in the campaign.

To create a campaign, follow the steps below:

1. Access the **Promotions & Taxes** module.
2. Click on the **Campaign Audiences** tab.
3. Click on the New Campaign button.
4. Give a name and a description for the campaign (both for internal store use).
5. Set an expiration date for the campaign.
6. Click on **Create new Target Audience**.
7. Name this target audience and then fill in the information regarding the items to be used. Here you can define which products will apply to this target audience by choosing categories, brands, collections or SKUs.
8. Define the conditions under which this target audience will apply.
9. Finally, click on **Update** and then on **Save**.
