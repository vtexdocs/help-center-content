## Creating a promotion

# 1. Promotion overview

In this section, you need to configure your promotion's general information. These are required fields: **Name**, **Expiration date**, and **What is the type and amount of discount?**.

- **Name:** Promotion name. Required field.
- **Status:** Activates or deactivates the promotion.
- **Description:** An internal description of the promotion. The purpose of this field is to be used as internal communication in your store to indicate whether the promotion comes from a campaign, clearance sale, etc.
- **Expiration date:** Start and end date and time of the promotion. You can use a future date and/or time for the promotion to start on your website. If configured this way, the promotion status will be displayed as follows:
  - **Scheduled:** Before the selected start date and time.
  - **Active:** During the scheduled promotion period.
  - **Inactive:** After the selected end date and time.
- **Use recurrence settings:** By selecting this option, you can configure the recurrence, such as the weekday and time.
- **What is the type and amount of discount?:**  Allows you to select one of the options below:
  - **Nominal:** Discount applied to the cart total.
  - **Nominal shipping:** Discount applied to the shipping cost.
  - **Percentage:** Percentage discount that will be applied to the product price.
  - **Maximum price per item:** The maximum price for each eligible item will be the price set above.
  - **Percentage:** Percentage discount that will be applied to the shipping cost.
  - **Maximum shipping:** Maximum amount for the shipping cost.
  - **Free shipping:** Full discount on shipping costs.
  - **Gift:** Full discount on the product amount set as a gift. By selecting this option, you can indicate the SKU (by name or ID) that will be considered a gift, choose if you want to activate the gift multiplier, and the maximum number of products that can be used as gifts in the promotion.
>ℹ️ The gift product must have a price associated with it, even though it is given to the customer for free.

  - **Nominal discount based on formula:** Discount calculated based on a formula you can create using the product total amount, shipping, and the number of items as variables. Please note that the shipping cost considered by the formula will be the lowest available for the order, regardless of the customer's selection. The decimal separator must always be a period. For example: If the discount is 30% of the product's total amount + shipping cost, the formula should be (total + freight) * 0.3. For more information about the formula, check out our [documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/promocao-regular-com-desconto-nominal-baseado-em-formula--2Pwrq6THyGViNedQG381jV).

  - **Promotional price table:** Price tables can be used as promotions. The promotional price of each SKU will be its corresponding price in the selected price table.
  - **Additional information (optional):** Allows you to add a name and value to the promotion.
  - **Promotion is highlighted:** Adds a tag with the promotion name to the window display and the product page. This tag will only be added if you use the right promotion display control in the template `<vtex.cmc:discountHightLight/>`.

# 4. Restrictions and limitations of use

In this section, you will find important information about the promotion conditions and restrictions.

- **How many times will this promotion be applied in your store:** Limits the number of times the promotion will be applied. If you uncheck the unlimited field, the **times** field becomes available to enter the maximum number of times the promotion can be used. This only applies for orders created after the condition has been set up. It will not affect orders placed previously.
- **How many times per customer will this promotion be applied in your store:** This field's value determines the maximum number of times each customer can benefit from the promotion. For example, if you set a limit of three uses and the promotion is applied three times on a single order, this will be considered a single use in relation to the total limit. This way, the customer can still use the promotion on two different orders. Note that this calculation is done regardless of how many times the promotion has been used on each individual order.
- **Set maximum number of eligible items for each cart:** Defines the maximum number of items in the cart that will be affected by the promotion.
