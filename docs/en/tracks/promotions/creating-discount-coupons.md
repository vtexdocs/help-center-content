The coupon is a code entered in the cart by the customer. It grants a discount on the price of the purchase.

Every coupon is created by the store itself in the Rates & benefits module.

There are two ways to create a coupon:
- Through the Coupons section.
- During the creation of a Regular Promotion.

In this article we will cover the first scenario.


### Creating a coupon through the Coupons section

To create a discount coupon, follow the steps below:

1. Access the Rates & benefits module.
2. Click on the **Coupons** option.
3. Click on the **New Coupon** button.
4. Create a coupon code (for example: `CHRISTMAS2020`).
5. Create an utm_source (for source tracking) and/or an utm_campaign (for campaign tracking).
6. Click on **Restrictions and limitations of use** and set the number of products that can be purchased using this coupon, regardless of how many purchases are made to reach that number.
7. Click on **Save**.

>ℹ️ It is not necessary to create an `utm_source` and an `utm_campaign`, but it is necessary to create **at least one** of them.
>
> 
> Read the article [What are utm_source, utm_campaign, and utm_medium](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-are-utm-source-utm-campaign-and-utm-medium--2wTz7QJ8KUG6skGAoAQuii) to better understand what these UTMs are.

When creating a regular promotion, you must select the `utm_source` and/or the `utm_campaign` boxes and insert the UTMs informed during the creation of the coupon in the corresponding fields.
