A __surcharge__ is an additional value expressed as a percentage that is inserted in the price of the product, in order to increase the amount charged to the customer. It therefore works like the opposite of a promotion.

The surcharge can be configured according to a number of conditions, which lead to its application or not. If it meets the defined conditions, it is inserted in the cart, in the area called __Tax__.

To create a surcharge, follow the steps below:
  
   1. Access the Rates & benefits module;
   2. Click on the __Taxes__ tab;
   3. Click on the __New Tax__ button;
   4. Fill in the general data of the surcharge, inform the items to which it will be applied and choose the conditions of application. To learn in detail the function of each field in the taxes configuration screen, read the article [How to create surcharges/taxes](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-surchargestaxes--tutorials_321).
   5. Click on __Save__.
