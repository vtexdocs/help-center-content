The VTEX Payment corporate digital account is opened easily and  without undue bureaucracy, following all recommendations established by Brazilâ€™s central bank.

Having a specific account for all business operations better coordinates the financial aspect of your business. 

## Account Summary 
In this section, stores can pay using their corporate digital account, either by "boletos" or bank transfer. You need to select the payment method to conclude the transaction.

## Bank statement 
VTEX Payment also allows you to check all corporate digital account statements.

This section has two tabs that organize the purchases by their transaction status. The first one shows the consolidated figures, in chronological order, which can be sales receivables or revenue.

The second tab shows scheduled payments, which commonly are receivables that will appear in the account according to the chosen payment method. According to the above-mentioned, stores can check their financial data periodically, such as choosing a 7-day time frame to see scheduled payments for example.
