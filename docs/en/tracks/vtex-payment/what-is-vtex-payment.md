VTEX Payment is a payment solution for VTEX clients, created to allow them to have a full overview of their business. It integrates functionalities stemming from four financial services, namely payment processing & validation, bank operations, e-commerce platform and financial reconciliation.

For transaction management, clients have access to a corporate digital account.

Furthermore, VTEX Payment has an optional Anti-Fraud service. The store can enable this service when contracting VTEX Payment or at a later date, as it does not hinder the functioning of VTEX Payment.

To increase security, this feature firstly verifies if there is any risk to the financial transactions before capture. In cases of fraud, for example, if the scammer attempts to make several purchases, the functionality spots the inconsistency in the first transactions and blocks the others.

In case this service is contracted, itâ€™s important to note that it does not provide chargeback guarantee.

All this can be fully operated through VTEX Admin as soon as the service is enabled.
