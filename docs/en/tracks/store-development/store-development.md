In an ecommerce store, both the interface that users see and interact with, and the way data is stored and handled are essential in development. Thus, an ecommerce store is divided mainly in the frontend (or storefront) and backend:

- **Frontend**: The frontend consists of the visual layer of an application, such as a website's or mobile app's interface. It is through it that users interact with a store. On VTEX, three different technologies can be used to build storefronts: the CMS Portal (Legacy), the Store Framework, and FastStore.
- **Backend**: The backend is the layer responsible for computing and processing all the data needed to execute the functionalities offered by a given application. On VTEX, the integration and backend application development are done mainly through VTEX IO and VTEX APIs.

In the following sections, we will further explore the key aspects and technologies related to store development on VTEX.

Other essential concepts for store development on VTEX are:

## Legacy CMS
On VTEX, storefronts can be built using the Legacy CMS, which manages all the content displayed in the store.

## VTEX Admin
The Admin is also critical for a store, and the VTEX Admin is where you can manage all the information you need to enhance business performance and make better decisions. 

## VTEX IO
Still focusing on performance and providing the best experience possible, VTEX introduced the VTEX IO concept to the market. VTEX IO is a low-code, cloud-based development platform that allows [developers](https://partnerportal.vtex.com/) to create ecommerce solutions. Its goal is to provide a cheaper and more efficient way to develop custom solutions and integrations within the VTEX ecosystem.  

The platform provides your store's development team with all the tools they need to focus on implementing the business problem without worrying about software compatibility and infrastructure issues. VTEX IO enables both frontend and backend development. 

## Store Framework
A low-code implementation framework that focuses on composability and provides many features to developers.

## FastStore
FastStore is the latest storefront solution provided by VTEX IO and is focused on performance.
