A VTEX IO app expands the features already offered by the VTEX platform. They can be used to add new features to a store, build storefronts, and expand the VTEX Admin features. These apps are built and launched on the platform with VTEX IO. You can develop the following:

- **Storefront apps**: Besides the blocks that VTEX already provides, you can create new blocks to customize what is not covered via VTEX's native blocks. These are React components that are part of the storefront.
You can find some storefront apps examples at [vtex-apps/location-availability](https://github.com/vtex-apps/location-availability), [vtex-apps/flow-finance-payment](https://github.com/vtex-apps/flow-finance-payment), [vtex-apps/yotpo](https://github.com/vtex-apps/yotpo).
- **Admin apps**: These apps are admin dashboards that are extension points in the VTEX admin alongside all Catalog, Order, and other platform management modules. You can create a fully customized admin module to centralize dashboards and different service operations.
You can find some admin apps examples at [vtex-apps/wish-list](https://github.com/vtex-apps/wish-list), [vtex-apps/reviews-and-ratings](https://github.com/vtex-apps/reviews-and-ratings), [vtex-apps/curbside-pickup](https://github.com/vtex-apps/curbside-pickup).
- **Backend apps**: This type of app allows you to create integrations between services using REST APIs or create GraphQL APIs to use data in custom React components. These are Node or .NET Core services that streamline connections with the admin or frontend.
You can find some backend apps examples at [vtex-apps/store-locator](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-locator), [vtex-apps/lightspeed](https://github.com/vtex-apps/lightspeed), [vtex-apps/wordpress-integration](https://github.com/vtex-apps/wordpress-integration).

VTEX IO apps can be made available in the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/) and can be paid or free. 

The VTEX App Store is a marketplace for VTEX plug-and-play solutions. Both apps developed by VTEX and certified partners are available for customers and partners to find customized solutions to build their stores. 

You can use the apps available in the VTEX App Store to:
- Connect to VTEX APIs and integrate with VTEX modules.
- Integrate third-party solutions to a VTEX account or store.
- Expand the native VTEX admin.
- Add storefront components to a Store Framework store.

To understand how to add an app to the VTEX App Store, follow the instructions in the [guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-10-making-your-app-publicly-available#submitting-your-app-to-the-vtex-app-store).
