2. Click on "Get";
3. Fill in the text box with the name of your [VTEX subaccount](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-store-name--3gh9mTNeMgs6Qe44e8IqQK), exactly as it appears in the Admin's URL;

_ex.: If you URL is “myshop.myvtex.com/admin”, then you should add "myshop" in the text box._

4. Click on the "Confirm order and begin installation" button;
5. You will be redirected to your VTEX admin page, where you will be able to complete the app installation by clicking on "install".

Done! Your app has been successfully installed! You will be automatically redirected to the app's configurations page and the app should now appear in your admin side bar (in the installed apps section).
