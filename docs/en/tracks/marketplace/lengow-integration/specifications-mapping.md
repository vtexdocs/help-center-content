[Specification fields](/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/2NQoBv8m4Yz3oQaLgDRagP) are additional properties that can be added to your products or SKUs. They can be submitted to enrich your catalog with information that is required by different channels. 

In the **Specifications mapping** section seen in *Marketplace > Lengow Integration > Settings*, you can send [product specifications](/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/2NQoBv8m4Yz3oQaLgDRagP#product-specification) or [SKU specifications](/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/2NQoBv8m4Yz3oQaLgDRagP#sku-specifications) to Lengow. Clicking on the <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tracks/marketplace/lengow-integration/specifications-mapping_2.png" style="width: 23px;" /> button adds a new row and clicking on the <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tracks/marketplace/lengow-integration/specifications-mapping_3.png" style="width: 23px;" /> button removes it from mapping tables.

For each specification, fill in the left column with its name in VTEX and the right column with the name that should be used in Lengow. Both columns may have the same values. If needed, you may repeat a VTEX specification to map it out to multiple Lengow specifications.

> ⚠️ All [specification fields](/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/2NQoBv8m4Yz3oQaLgDRagP) must be created and set up prior to this step. Make sure the name used in the mapping tables is exactly as seen in the Catalog, otherwise the connector will not be able to find the proper values to send to Lengow.
