After creating your Google Merchant Center account, define the [trade policy](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) that you are going to use. When you [configure a trade policy for a marketplace](/en/tutorial/configurando-a-politica-comercial-para-marketplace/), you determine which products will be submitted to Google Shopping and their price on the platform.

In most cases, we recommend choosing the main trade policy (ID: 1), as Google Shopping results direct buyers to purchase from advertisers’ stores. Therefore, the integration will submit all the products available in your store to Google at the same advertised prices.

You will need to request the creation of a new trade policy only if you want to: 
- Offer a different product assortment on Google Shopping.
- Sell products at different prices on Google Shopping.

To [request additional trade policies](/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), please open a ticket to our [Support](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support) by selecting Commercial and Create a trade policy.

To [purchase additional commercial policies](/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), simply request it via ticket in our [Support](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support) by selecting the **Commercial** option and the request type **Creation of Commercial Policy.**

For each additional trade policy, a monthly fee is charged, whether it is used for integration with certified marketplaces, partners, external or VTEX.
