Check out how to integrate your store with Google Shopping using the connector developed by VTEX. It should be your standard choice, as it provides more efficiency and security.

> ❗ The integration can be performed via [XML](/en/docs/tutorials/configuring-xml) . We do not recommend integrating with [Google Shopping using an XML file](/en/docs/tutorials/how-to-configure-xml-for-google-shopping) and the native connector simultaneously, because this might lead to conflicting information and data discrepancy.

To integrate using the connector, **you must have a Google Merchant Center account.** If you don't have one, check out the tutorial [sign up for Google Merchant Center](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188924?hl=en&ref_topic=7294166).

These are the next steps to integrate your VTEX store with Google Shopping:

1. [Define the trade policy](/en/docs/tracks/defining-the-google-shopping-trade-policy)
2. [Configure the connector](/en/docs/tracks/configuring-the-connector)
3. [Authenticate your account](/en/docs/tracks/authenticating-your-google-shopping-account)
4. [Submit products to Google Shopping](/en/docs/tracks/sending-products-to-google-shopping)
5. [Configure the feed](/en/docs/tracks/configuring-the-feed)

Make sure you meet all the Google [requirements for Shopping campaigns](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6275312) to guarantee that your integration will work properly.
