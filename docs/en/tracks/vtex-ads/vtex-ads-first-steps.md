**VTEX Ads** is the VTEX retail media solution for turning stores into media platforms and connecting with brands and marketing agencies in an integrated ecosystem.

With VTEX Ads, brands (advertisers) can buy advertising spaces directly in the ecommerce websites of merchants (publishers).

Ads are displayed natively, integrated into the browsing and buying experience, and can be segmented based on transactional and behavioral data.

## Differentiators

* **Centralized campaigns**  
  Activate retail media campaigns without using multiple platforms. Everything can be managed directly through VTEX Ads.

* **Real-time measurement**  
  Track campaign returns with visibility of ROI, attribution, and real-time budget use.

* **Self-service platform**  
  Create, edit, and manage campaigns autonomously, with control over audience, budget, and products.

* **Flexible solution**  
  Adapt the tool to different business models, with a configurable structure to meet your needs.
