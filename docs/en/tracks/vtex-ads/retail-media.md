Retail media transforms sales channels, such as websites, apps, and physical stores, into strategic advertising spaces. This approach allows merchants and brands to run targeted campaigns directly on consumer touchpoints during the buying journey.

Retail media stands out for leveraging consumer shopping behavior data to create custom campaigns, enabling more efficient measurement than other advertising formats.

## VTEX Ads

VTEX Ads is the VTEX retail media solution, designed to operationalize and scale this type of advertising within the retail ecosystem. It enables merchants and brands to create, manage, and measure ads across their own environments (such as ecommerce websites), external channels, and physical points of sale.

While browsing an ecommerce site, opening a shopping app, or visiting a physical store, consumers may come across campaigns activated through VTEX Ads, such as sponsored product shelves or promotional banners. All these touchpoints can be used as media vehicles.

## Retail media strategies

VTEX Ads supports multiple advertising strategies, grouped into two main formats:

* **Onsite**: Ads displayed in digital channels owned by the merchant, like ecommerce websites, apps, telesales, etc.  
* **In-store**: Activations in the merchant's physical stores, like digital displays and point-of-sale promotions.

These formats engage consumers at different stages of the buying journey, from brand awareness to conversion.

## Campaign types

VTEX Ads allows you to set up different campaign types to achieve specific objectives during the buying journey. We describe each available type below.

### Sponsored products

Sponsored product ads are the most common format in retail media. Sponsored products are displayed in strategic positions, such as search results and product listing pages, based on keywords and categories accessed by the consumer. This increases product visibility and the conversion rate.

### Banner/Display

Banners or displays are used to promote specific products and offers, typically shown in selected areas of the site, such as category pages or the homepage. This format focuses on visually highlighting promotions.

### In-store display

This campaign type uses LED or LCD screens in physical stores to display campaigns and promotions. These displays can be used to increase brand awareness and promote specific offers based on consumer buying behavior.
