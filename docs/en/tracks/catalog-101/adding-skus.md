There are three ways to add a SKU: in VTEX Admin, by spreadsheet or through ERP.

Follow the steps below to start creating your SKUs:

## VTEX Admin

There are two flows which can be used to add SKUs through the VTEX Admin: creating an SKU immediately after adding a product or adding a SKU to an already existing product.

### Adding SKUs after creating a product

1.	On the Product creation page, after filling out the fields, click on **Save and add new SKU**.

2.	You will be redirected to the SKU form page, where you need to fill out fields. For more on each field’s meaning, access our article on [how to fill in SKU creation fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sku-fields--21DDItuEQc6mseiW8EakcY). 
3.	Click on `Save`.

### Adding SKUs to an already existing product

1.	Click on **Catalog**.
2.	Click on **Products and SKUs**.
3.	Following the product line, select the dropdown menu by clicking on the arrow down, to the right of the `Update` button.
4.	Click on `SKU`.
5.	Click on `New SKU`.
6.	You will be redirected to the SKU form page, where you’ll need to fill out fields. For more on each field’s meaning, access our article on [how to fill in SKU creation fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sku-fields--21DDItuEQc6mseiW8EakcY). 

### Adding an image to the SKU

After adding a SKU you’ll need to also link an image to it in order to activate it. Follow the steps below to add an image:

1.	On the page where you added a SKU, click on the **Images** tab

2.	Click on `Insert` and choose the image you want to add.
3.	Fill out the **Text** (image alt tag) and **Label** fields. The label will be used to assist with your site’s page template organization, by referencing the value contained within, i.e. front, side, upper side, etc.
4.	Click on `Send`.

### Add SKU specifications

After adding the images, you must add the SKU specifications. The next step on this track will explain how to add specifications.

1.	Click on the **Specifications** tab.

2.	Fill out the mandatory fields. Specifications may vary according to the selected SKU category.
3.	Click on `Save`.

### Link an SKU to an already existing product

1. Click on __Catalog__.
2. Click on __Products and SKUs__.
3. On the same horizontal as the product, click on the blue __arrow down__ next to the `Update` button.
4. Click on __SKU__.
5. On the right side of the page, click on `Change`.
6. Click on `Advanced Search`.
7. In the box that appears on the screen, select the __Product ID__ option;
8. In the __keyword__ field, fill in the ID of the product you want to link to that SKU.
9. Click on `Apply and close`.
10. Lastly, click on `Save`, which you will find scrolling down the page.

>❗ Before saving the configurations, make sure that all SKU mandatory information is filled out. Otherwise, the SKU will not be linked to the product.

## Spreadsheet
