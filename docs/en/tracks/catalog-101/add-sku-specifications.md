There are currently three ways of adding SKU specifications: either through admin, spreadsheet or ERP.

>⚠️ In VTEX, specifications follow a logic of "inheritance", that is, when creating a specification at a higher category level, the specification will be presented at all category levels below it. Therefore, if you need to create a product or SKU specification that applies to only one category, it should be created at that category's level.

Follow the steps highlighted below in order to add specifications:

## Admin
To add the specifications, your store already needs to have departments, categories and subcategories. After ensuring that the above-mentioned are already created, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Catalog**
2. Click on **Categories** 
3. Select the category you wish to add specifications to
4. A small blue rectangle will pop up on the screen. Click on **Actions**
5. Click on **SKU Field**
6. Click on **New Field** 
7. Fill out the specification form fields. In the case of SKUs, the mandatory fields flag is selected by default. For more info on each field, access our article on [how to fill out SKU specification fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-sku-fields--tutorials_119) 
8. Click on **Save**

## Spreadsheet

To add your specifications using a spreadsheet, you first need to export a default VTEX spreadsheet by following the steps below:  

1. Click on **Catalog**
2. Select **Import and Export**
3. Click on the **SKU specifications** tab
4. Right-click above the desired category
5. Click on **Export**
6. A green rectangle will pop up on the screen
7. Select **Click here to download file** to export the spreadsheet

Open the received spreadsheet and fill in the SKU specification data.

Only edit the  "Specification Value" spreadsheet column. The remaining columns must remain unchanged because their values will be used for data validation.
