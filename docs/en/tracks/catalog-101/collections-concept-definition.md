## Definition

The collection is the grouping of two or more SKUs that may or may not have characteristics in common to be displayed on your store product pages.

Usually, you can group SKUs by category or brand, but you can create collections to associate SKUs using other grouping criteria such as holidays, launches, or best-selling products. 

For example, you can create Valentine's Day page and list gifts suitable for this occasion by creating a "gift" collection.
