VTEX Catalog architecture is based on four fundamental concepts:

1.	Category
2.	Product
3.	SKU
4.	Specifications

At VTEX, __Categories__ represent the way you organize your products, generically dividing items available in your store.

When organized into categories, products can be classified into three distinct levels: __Department__, __Category__, and __Subcategory__.

For a __Product__ to be made available in your store, it needs to be part of a category and be linked to at least one __SKU__. 

VTEX Catalog structure requires that a SKU can only be created after defining the product information, since the SKU itself is the product variation. Therefore, we can say that a SKU is the physical unit of a product in stock.

VTEX Catalog architecture also includes __Specifications__, which are a categoryâ€™s registered properties that attribute specific characteristics to that product and SKUs linked to it. 

Such specifications are, for example, a product's composition or an SKU's voltage, size or color.

An example of a VTEX Catalog architecture blueprint is found below:
