There are three ways to add a product: in the VTEX Admin, by spreadsheet or through API.

Before creating a product, you must have created the __Brand__ and __Category__ that correspond to it. Both need to be active in order for the product to be created.

Read the following sections of this article to start creating your products.

## VTEX Admin

In the VTEX Admin, follow the steps below.

1.	Click on __Catalog__.
2.	Click on __All products__ .
3.	Click on `Add Product`.
4.	Fill out the product form fields. For more on what each field means, read our article on [product registration fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/product-registration-fields--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke).
5.	Click on `Save` or `Save and add new SKU`, in case you want to add SKUs associated to that product.

## Spreadsheet

We recommend that you add products and SKUs together when using a spreadsheet. You can check out the steps on the [Adding SKU](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/17PxekVPmVYI4c3OCQ0ddJ) article of this track.

## API

To add a new product via API use the [Create Product](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/post-product) request. 

>ℹ️ If your product does not appear on your store's website after you have created it, check out the article [Why is the product not shown on the website?](https://help.vtex.com/pt/faq/why-is-the-product-not-shown-on-the-website--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382) to understand how to solve this problem.
