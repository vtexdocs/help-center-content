There are different ways to add a product:

- VTEX Admin
- Importing spreadsheet
- API

<div class = "alert alert-info">
  <p>Before creating a product, you must have created and activated its corresponding brand and category.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If your product does not appear on your store's website after you have created it, check out the article <a href="https://help.vtex.com/pt/faq/why-is-the-product-not-shown-on-the-website--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382">Why is the product not shown on the website?</a> to understand how to solve this problem.

## VTEX Admin

To add a new product to the store catalog, check the article [Adding or editing products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-or-editing-products--29IkdEu6GofCFlltsZh2H8).

## Spreadsheet

We recommend that you add products and SKUs together when using a spreadsheet. You can check out the steps on the [Adding SKU](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/17PxekVPmVYI4c3OCQ0ddJ) article of this track.

## API

To add a new product via API use the [Create product with category and brand](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/product) endpoint. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
