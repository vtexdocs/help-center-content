Categories exist for the purpose of organizing your product assortment within your ecommerce. They work as hierarchical levels of product classification. The organization by category makes your client’s search for a product easier and keeps your catalog organized. 

The three main category levels are called __Department__, __Category__, and __Subcategory__.

Categories are also where you need to configure the Specifications (or Fields), that represent the properties you will add to the products or SKUs. We will have a closer look at the relationship between categories, products, SKUs and specifications during the next steps.

>ℹ️ We suggest that your store’s category trees have no more than three levels of hierarchy. This will allow your customers to browse your store with more ease.

## Department

The __Department__ is a store’s first category level.

It is the highest level within the categories tree. More specific categories should be registered within the department.

## Category

The category tree’s second hierarchy level is called __Category__. This level is under the __Department__ level and above the __Subcategory__ level.

>ℹ️ The term "category" is typically used to refer to a generic segmentation concept. At VTEX, the term "Category" is also used to refer to the category tree’s second hierarchy level.

## Subcategory 

Lastly, we have the __Subcategories__. This level is under both the __Department__ and __Category__ levels, according to the classification hierarchy.

## Examples

Imagine that an e-commerce’s departments function as large sections of a business. 

A drugstore network may have *Departments* called __Prescription Drugs__, __Hygiene__ and __Makeup__. Within each of these three large sections, products are organized into *Categories*, which are then further segmented.

Let’s take a closer look at the __Hygiene__ Department. Within this segment, we can create a category called __Personal Care__. In turn, a *Subcategory* called __Soaps__ can be added to this segment. 

Categories are interlinked, therefore, a product associated with the __Soaps__ Subcategory is also part of the __Personal Care__ Category and the __Hygiene__ Department.

Thus, if the retailer applies a 10% discount to all __Hygiene__ department products, this discount is cascaded to all categories and subcategories related to this department.
