## Track overview

This track presents the journey of a VTEX store from its initial settings to the go-live. But before configuring the platform [modules](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/75MX4aorniD0BYAB8Nwbo7), planning [backend integrations](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu), and choosing a [frontend](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/67SCtUreXxKYWhZh8n0zvZ) technology for building the storefront, there's a preliminary step: determining the [account type and architecture](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl) that best align with your business needs.

Each ecommerce operation has its own particularities and this content is not intended to encompass all possible scenarios. Our goal is to provide a general model and present the features and possibilities of the VTEX platform.

The content is organized sequentially for educational purposes; however, this does not imply that the steps need to be executed in order or that the previous step is a block for the next. Some steps can be completed in parallel, at least partially, such as backend integrations, settings for some modules, and frontend implementation.
