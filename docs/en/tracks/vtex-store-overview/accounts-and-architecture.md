VTEX provides many features and products, but their availability can vary depending on the [account type](#vtex-account-types), as each one is designed for certain scenarios. Before you start planning your [store's architecture](#store-architecture) and defining [implementation partners](#implementation-partners), you need to know the main characteristics of the accounts.

## VTEX account types

The definition of a VTEX store's architecture depends on the VTEX account type, as some features are exclusive to certain account types, and each account is tailored to particular business models. The best account will be the one that best reflects the business model's structure.

VTEX account types are:

- **Main account (or standard):** The VTEX core account includes all the native settings and allows setting up a store website and requesting all platform features.
- [Franchise account](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-conta-franquia--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl): The franchise account is associated with a main account. It does not have its own website, and its most remarkable characteristic is that it does not configure its own catalog, which comes from the main account. This account type is recommended for operations with physical stores, franchisees, and brand representatives, but the store does not necessarily need to have a franchise network to benefit from the advantages of a VTEX franchise account.
- [Seller Portal account](/en/tutorial/seller-criar-conta-no-seller-portal--3gn2Q5rMhgu0jjX7AiiHcs): This account is associated with a main account. It does not have its own website, and its main characteristic is to make the store a marketplace for [white label sellers](/en/tutorial/seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa) or sellers outside the VTEX ecosystem who can quickly integrate their catalog in the VTEX marketplace. In other words, it is a VTEX platform edition designed for the main account's sellers.

The following image is an overview to help you [choose between standard, franchise, or Seller Portal accounts](/en/tutorial/escolher-entre-conta-padrao-conta-franquia-ou-seller-portal--4S90HzzhMyZESsHqrnUs78):

## Account characteristics

[Choosing between a standard, franchise, or Seller Portal account](/en/tutorial/escolher-entre-conta-padrao-conta-franquia-ou-seller-portal--4S90HzzhMyZESsHqrnUs78) involves many factors. The table below shows the main characteristics of each to help guide your decision:

## Store architecture

The VTEX platform provides many business models and sizes with all the features and settings they need for your operations. For instance, a store can adopt a different strategy for each sales channel through [trade policies](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4EPwTXx5oFdSG1dA3zIchz#trade-policy) by configuring different catalog, price, and logistics settings for each one. To do so, the only requirement is to [request new trade policies](/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X).

However, using many trade policies simultaneously can compromise the store's performance and slow it down, as changes need to be updated across multiple trade policies. Therefore, depending on the business model and complexity of the operation, you can segment using the following options:

- [Multistores](#multistore)  
- [Additional environments](#additional-environment) 

The image below is an example of how the main account, environment, multi-store, and trade policies are related:

![multistore_aditional_environment_EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview/accounts-and-architecture_2.png)

### Multistore

[Multistore, or multidomain](/en/tutorial/escolhendo-entre-arquitetura-multi-loja-ou-ambiente-adicional--4HRNpa1OCKZ5YzP8yiilBL), is the feature that allows you to create other stores associated with the main account, all managed in the same admin environment. Each store will have its own [storefront](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/67SCtUreXxKYWhZh8n0zvZ) and domain, but they can share module settings, such as catalog, logistics, prices, and others.

The main advantages of [creating multistores](/en/tutorial/como-criar-multiloja-multidominio--tutorials_510) include the ease with which the company can sell different niche products, the convenience of selling multiple brands, and the agility of making different products available in different stores and channels.

The following scenarios illustrate the strategic role of having multiple stores in the same environment:

- **National and international stores:** One store is focused on the country of origin, and the other on the international market.
- **Niche segmentation:** Companies with a broad niche, operating different stores, each segmented to offer a variety of products focused on distinct audiences.
- **Different operations:** When a business operates both B2C and B2B models, for example, it can be strategic to have separate stores for each type of operation, but sharing settings and information, allowing unified management.

In addition to combining trade policies and multistores, at VTEX, you can request a new environment, as described below.

### Additional environment

A standard VTEX account can completely separate the management space for your operations by [requesting a new environment.](/en/tutorial/contratar-novo-ambiente--tutorials_2542) Each VTEX Admin will be associated with its own account and independently manage the storefront settings and platform modules.

Some typical use cases for requesting a new environment are when you want an [environment exclusively for testing](/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/6xYnNxDHUcY6FyChgziCoH#4-testing-before-the-go-live) (Quality Assurance - QA) or an environment dedicated to managing another operation, such as B2C, B2B, or B2E.

## Choosing between multistore and additional environment

The table below highlights important aspects to consider when deciding whether to have a multistore architecture, an additional environment, or a combination of both:  

| **Characteristic** | **Multistore** | **Additional environment** |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| Architecture | A **single admin environment** in the VTEXAdmin associated with two or more stores ([store names](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-store-name--3gh9mTNeMgs6Qe44e8IqQK)). All stores are linked to the **same [account name](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-account-name--i0mIGLcg3QyEy8OCicEoC)**. | **Multiple admin environments** in the VTEX Admin with fully independent settings. Each environment has its own **[account name](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-account-name--i0mIGLcg3QyEy8OCicEoC)**. |
| Sitemap | Has a single main account **[sitemap](/en/tutorial/rastreamento-google-search-console-sitemap--tutorials_575) shared** among all stores. | Each account has its own **[sitemap](/pt/tutorial/rastreamento-google-search-console-sitemap--tutorials_575)**. |
| Sales segmentation | Stores can **segment shopping experiences using trade policies**. This also helps ensure store performance, as you don't need multiple active trade policies. | The possibilities for sales segmentation and customization are huge, as each environment can **combine different trade policies and multistores**. |
| Team | A **single team manages the operation** or, despite different teams, the similarities in settings across stores make it more efficient for them to share catalog, logistics, and pricing settings, for example. All users are **managed by the same [License Manager](/en/tutorial/visao-geral-do-modulo-license-manager)**. | **Different teams** within the same company have different operational responsibilities. **Each environment has its License Manager**, so [users](/en/tutorial/gerenciando-usuarios--tutorials_512) in each of them are managed separately. |
| Costs | **There is no cost** for creating new stores, but there is a cost for creating different storefronts, as you need to [request an additional trade policy](/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X). | **There is a cost** to [request an additional environment](/en/tutorial/contratar-novo-ambiente--tutorials_2542?&utm_source=autocomplete), but this already includes a trade policy.|

When building a store, it is common for agencies and [implementation partners](https://vtex.com/us-en/partners/) (System Integration partners) to be involved. VTEX is associated with a wide ecosystem of partners known for their excellence and reliability in developing VTEX store projects. Provided the [user](/en/tutorial/gerenciando-usuarios--tutorials_512) has permission to access the store's VTEX Admin, they can view the partner list on the [Partner Portal](https://partnerportal.vtex.com/) (available only in Portuguese).

The [VTEX Quadrant](https://vtex.com/pt-br/blog/parceiros/quadrante_vtex_2023/) is a program in which VTEX internally evaluates the performance and successful results of its partners' operations. This annual acknowledgment and reward is for those with the highest commitment and excellence. See the results of the 2022 Quadrant [here](https://vtex.com/pt-br/blog/parceiros/quadrante_vtex_2023/). The VTEX Quadrant is an exclusive program for implementation partners in Brazil.
