Personal data or _Personally Identifiable Information_ (PII) is any information relating to a natural person that is capable of identifying them directly (such as name, ID number, and email address) or indirectly (such as IP addresses, physical addresses, and [cookies](https://vtex.com/us-en/privacy-and-agreements/vtex-platform-cookies-information/)).

Sensitive personal data is information related to ethnicity, religious beliefs, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life, and genetic or biometric data. Misuse of this type of data can lead to severe harm or discriminatory treatment of the data subject.

## Personal data processed by VTEX

VTEX processes customers' personal data only when necessary, complying with the requirements of each platform module to carry out ecommerce operations. See below the list of personal data that VTEX may process:

* Name

* Navigation information ([cookies](https://vtex.com/us-en/privacy-and-agreements/vtex-platform-cookies-information/))
* Cart information
* Order details and history
* Delivery address

The data list above is described in the [Data Processing Addendum (DPA)](#data-processing-addendum-dpa).

VTEX does not sell, monetize, enrich, or transfer any customer personal data to other companies.

## Data minimization

The principle of data minimization refers to collecting, processing, and storing only the information strictly necessary to achieve a specific purpose. This principle makes it possible to limit the amount of personal data collected and retained, thus reducing the risks associated with excessive information processing.

In this sense, VTEX collects only the minimum amount of data necessary to process the orders received, which means only the personal data strictly necessary for ecommerce operations.
