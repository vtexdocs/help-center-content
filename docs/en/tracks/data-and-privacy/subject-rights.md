A data subject request is a written request that your store's customers can make to exercise their right to obtain information about the data being processed by the store and VTEX.

Anyone has the right to confirm whether a store is processing their data. If so, the data subject also has the right to access the data and know the purpose of the processing, the personal data categories, and the recipients or categories of recipients with whom their personal data has been shared.

To learn more, check the [Data subject rights](/en/tutorial/data-subject-rights--6imchxTx09icupKMbzHVIM) guide.

## Erasing data

At any time, merchants can erase personal data upon customer request. The end customer must make the request to the merchant directly, and the merchant must forward these requests to VTEX. The right to erasure overrides the retention period.

If you manage a VTEX store and need help erasing user data, see [Erasing customer data](/en/tutorial/erasing-customer-data--1R9Fn7A06Ifj4R9YD4JTKU). 

## Editing data

All your customers' personal data is editable on the[ My Account](/en/tutorial/how-my-account-works--2BQ3GiqhqGJTXsWVuio3Xh) page, except for their email addresses. In this case, you can delete the old profile and create a new one using a different email address.
