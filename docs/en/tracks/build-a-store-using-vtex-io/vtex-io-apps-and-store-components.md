In VTEX IO, __apps__ are packages of code and configuration that enable new features in a VTEX account when installed. In order to create your own store, you will *develop, publish and install* your own app - specifically, a __store theme app__.

A store theme app does two things: 

- Declares templates by configuring and combining blocks. A block is a component with a set of fixed properties, for example, a shelf that displays 4 products. 
- Declares styles by configuring a set of variables, such as primary and secondary colors, typography and spacing scales, etc. 

You declare blocks based on any of the available [Store Components](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components), our set of high-quality, open-source and configurable ecommerce components. For more advanced customization, you'll also be able to mount your own custom React components in extension points.

You can [read more about VTEX IO](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-io-getting-started), but, for now, all we need to do is set you up with the developer tools you need to start coding.
