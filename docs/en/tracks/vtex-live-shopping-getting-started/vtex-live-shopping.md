The [Live Shopping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/live-shopping--1cYWPIbjNMyr072sksHSVL) app enables stores to create immersive, real-time shopping experiences directly on their storefronts. Merchants can live stream events on their store's website to promote product collections, increase sales, and enhance user experience, while interacting via live chat.
