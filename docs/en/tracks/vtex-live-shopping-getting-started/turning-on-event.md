The first step to live-stream an event is to turn it on. This action will not start the event transmission, but it will enable you to make all the necessary configurations. 

> ⚠️ Before your store's first live event, we strongly recommend you to conduct a [test event](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/1le8tz3fyBdb7kR4UdxTjZ#testing-the-tool) to validate product setup, stream quality, and interactivity.

To turn an event on, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > Live Shopping > Events**, or type **Events** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the line of the event you wish to activate, click the arrow button in the **Action** column.
3. On the **Event Information** page, at the top right, click the switch `Turn On` to activate the event.

> ❗ After clicking on **Turn on**, the process of activating the event takes about 3 to 5 minutes.

After the **Turn on** switch is enabled, you can close the page if you wish, but remember that the event will be automatically completed after 1h30. The count is automatically reset when you start transmitting. 

> For example, when you start an event, it won’t be finalized automatically after the mentioned time frame, but after you stop streaming it, if no new transmission begins within 1h30, then the event is finalized.

## Event details

Once the [event is turned on](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/6NrWRLAJEHijcd6tLIWoqq), all configurations are enabled for setup and in the **Details** section, you will see the following information:

| **Field name** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- |
| ID | Event ID, its unique identifier. |
| Event name | Name of the event. |
| UTM source | [UTM source](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-are-utm-source-utm-campaign-and-utm-medium--2wTz7QJ8KUG6skGAoAQuii) configured to track the event. |
| Minutes used | Transmission duration minutes in real time. It only starts counting from the moment you start to broadcast the event. |
| Inbound server | Server code used to connect the event between different VTEX stores or other platforms, such as Facebook and Youtube. |
| Server key | Server key identification used to connect the event between different VTEX stores or other platforms. |

In this section you can monitor the [event status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/5WLXGbOSFmxN7QlzOnfGrv#event-status), as shown in the image below:

> ℹ️ After turning on the event, if you don't transmit it and lack interaction with it for more than 90 minutes, the event status will move to `Completed`, meaning it is finished and can no longer be broadcasted.
