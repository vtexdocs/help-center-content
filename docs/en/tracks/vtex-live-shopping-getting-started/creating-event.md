To create a new live-streaming event, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > Live Shopping > Events**, or type **Events** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click `New` to create a new live-streaming event.
3. In the **New Event** page, fill out these fields with the following information:
    * **Event Name:** The desired name for the event being created. We recommend using an easy identification.
    * **UTM Source:** Tracking parameters added to your URL, which helps you to track and analyze traffic from different sources. This is created by default according to the event name.
    * **(Optional) Collection ID:** The ID of the desired product collection to be attached to the live stream event, up to 50 products per collection. During the event, these items can be shown to customers via sidebar (default) and/or via carousel, depending on your settings in the CMS Configuration section. 
    * **(Optional) Event Time:** Information regarding the event date and time that helps to identify it easily on your **Events** list. This information will display future events and will have no impact over the current one. Be aware that this field is not related to the Go Live.
    * **(Optional) Event Category:** Category type of the event used for an easier identification of the event on your landing page. 
4. Click `Save changes`.

Once you have completed the steps below,, the event will be created and it will appear in the list of the **Events** page with the status `Created`.
