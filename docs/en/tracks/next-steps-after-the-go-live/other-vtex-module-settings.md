In the **VTEX Store Overview Track**, the [VTEX modules I](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/75MX4aorniD0BYAB8Nwbo7) and [VTEX modules II](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/3MYcZaojb5HSUg6ufm6GxQ) articles cover the main configurations for each topic. The current article presents other module settings that are not required for the [go-live](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/6xYnNxDHUcY6FyChgziCoH).

## Promotions

Once you have configured the required [Promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/75MX4aorniD0BYAB8Nwbo7#promocoes) settings, you should also learn more about [customer clusters](#customer-clusters), [promotion competition](#promotion-competition), and [marketplace promotions](#marketplace-promotions), as shown below.

### Customer clusters

To provide exclusive purchasing advantages for a specific group of people or companies, you can [create custom promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-promotion-for-a-customer-cluster--tutorials_342) for a customer cluster in your store. In this context, promotion details will only be displayed in the shopping cart after the selected customers log in to the site. 

### Promotion competition

When the store has multiple active promotions with similar characteristics that could be applied to the same product simultaneously, we have a scenario of promotion competition. In this situation, you should understand the priority in which the promotions will be applied to the product to ensure that the sales strategy is being used correctly.

Learn more in the [How promotion competition works](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-promotion-competition-works--tutorials_2270) article.

### Marketplace promotions

Stores operating as a VTEX marketplace can only configure [regular promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/promotions--6asfF1vFYiZgTQtOzwJchR/7FjbeZdE2KMwk5L1t98pZI) for their products, such as:

- Free shipping
- Percentage shipping
- Percentage price
- Price tables

## Logistics

After completing the required [logistics](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/75MX4aorniD0BYAB8Nwbo7#logistc) settings, VTEX accounts with [multistore or multidomain](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl#multiloja) architecture can launch a sales strategy to other countries and become [cross-border stores](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/5qgXy9Erm7FDP3UB5Ox8Bs). The main advantages of this type of operation include:

- **Improved total logistics capacity:** The accumulated experience gained in complex logistics processes (import and export) means that the entire logistics chain (national and international) can be managed more efficiently.
- **Business expansion:** Reaching new customers and increasing the stores' sales potential.
- **Tax advantages:** International operations may benefit from tax incentives, such as tax exemptions, which can reduce the total cost of selling a product.
- **Brand internationalization:** Consolidating the company's image in different markets, increasing consumer confidence and sales at national and international levels.

Cross-border operations must be planned considering the following aspects:

- **Export type:**
  -  **Direct:** The company is solely accountable for product distribution and delivery to customers.
  -  **Indirect:** The products are purchased by third parties (business partners or intermediaries located in the country of destination), assuming full responsibility for managing the operation.

- **Accepting products:** Checking sales strategies and public preferences in the market where you want to operate.

- **Intelligent pricing:** Determining a pricing strategy based on local costs (transportation, fees, taxes).

- **Partners:** Establishing partnerships with local carriers and suppliers.

- **Competitive advantages:** Defining how the business can offer advantages to customers in the new market compared to current competitors.

For more information on how to start a cross-border operation, contact your CX manager or [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/7w7cUmbrdPEKpTMItjXEB8).

 ## Orders

After configuring the required [Order](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview-eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/3MYcZaojb5HSUg6ufm6GxQ#orders) settings, you can boost your store sales by offering recurring order subscriptions and optimizing order management in the VTEX Admin using VTEX DO.

### Subscriptions

To allow customers to make recurring purchases of their favorite products at their desired frequency automatically, you can set up a repurchase schedule in the platform's [Subscription System](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-subscriptions-work--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453).

### VTEX DO

[VTEX DO](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-do-interface--7KMbRL4OslN8DTX9oiuCiu) is the management system for tasks related to order processing in the store. It allows store operators to manually process tasks that are automatically created by the VTEX Admin. VTEX DO offers the following features:

- Search and filter by status (open, not assigned) or subject (catalog, commercial, infrastructure).
- Access details and information for completing each task.
- Assign [users](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-users--tutorials_512) to tasks.

### VTEX Social Selling

[VTEX Social Selling](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-ativar-o-app-carrinho-compartilhavel--1lS3fQdXpOoC0BTeVhydfg) allows sales associates to select products and share them with customers via communication channels such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and email. This feature can be used in online and physical store operations ([VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/next-steps-after-the-go-live--3J7WFZyvTcoiwkcIVFVhIS/1t2QBZvrOBSLgvHaAV9fYm#vtex-sales-app)).

## B2B Suite
[B2B Suite](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/b2b-suite-overview--5eG6UfveWrai7looK0kVG3#b2b-suite-apps) is a collection of [VTEX IO apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) that helps stores manage organizations, permissions, and checkout settings in B2B scenarios, among other benefits. This is very important for streamlining the purchase flow, reducing costs, and providing a personalized shopping experience.

### B2B Suite apps
B2B Suite apps were developed to drive B2B operations. The main apps are described below.

- **Storefront Permissions:** manages access permissions for different users and groups within the store.
- **Storefront Permissions UI:** allows VTEX Admin users to manage B2B functions and associated app permissions through the Admin itself.
- **B2B Organizations:** groups B2B users into organizations, to which specific payment methods, price tables, and product collections can be assigned.
- **B2B Quotes & Carts:** allows the creation of quotes and the management of shopping carts for companies.
- **B2B Checkout Settings:** configures specific payment methods, pre-filled addresses, purchase order numbers, and order quotes.
- **B2B Orders History:** allows B2B users to view all previous orders placed by their organization or cost center.
