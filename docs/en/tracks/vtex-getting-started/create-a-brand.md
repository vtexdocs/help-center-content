Every product in your store needs to be part of a category, but it also needs to have a brand.

To register one, follow the steps below:

1. In the __Catalog__ module, hover your mouse over the __Product__ tab and click on the __Brand__.
2. Click the __New Brand__ button.
3. Enter the brand name in the __Name__ field.
4. Fill in the __Brand Page Title (Tag Title)__ field with the title that will appear in the browser tab when the user enters the brand page.
5. Check the flag __Activate Brand__ to make the mark active on the site.

That's it, your brand is created and it can already be assigned to products from your store.

Check out the complete list of fields that can be filled for brand registration in the article [Fill in brand registration fields](/en/tutorial/brand-registration-fields).
