Once your categories tree is defined, you can already enter the categories in the form.

## Create a category

In VTEX, the category registration is done in the __Catalog__ module.

1. In the menu of your Admin's topbar, click __Catalog__ (if you are not already there).
2. From the __Products Management__ tab options, click __Category__.

On the left side of the screen, you'll see the highest level of categories, which by default is named __Categories__. It's within this level that we are going to distribute the categories of your tree.
Click on it and follow the steps below:

1. Click the __actions__ button that appears to the right of your screen.
2. Click on __Include __.

You can see the complete list of the category registration fields [in this article](/en/tutorial/category-registration-fields).
But here we will stick to a few fields.

1. In the __Name__ field, enter the name you want to give the category. Following the example we used in the [article about category trees](/en/getting-started/create-the-category-tree), let's create the *Women* category.
2. In the __Category Page Title (Tag Title)__ field, define the text that will appear in the browser tab when the user enters the page of that category.
3. In the __VTEX Global Category__ field, search for the category that best fits the category you are creating - this will help your products to be found. Learn more about the global category [in this article](/en/tutorial/setting-up-the-global-category). Here, let's choose the global category *Roupas* (*Clothing*).
4. Check the __Active__ flag so that the category is available to be displayed on the site.
5. Click __Save__.

You can do a lot more with this category, but with the settings above it will already be available to be used.

## Create a sibling category

In our example, the *Men* category is a sibling category of the *Women* one. That is, both have the same hierarchical level.
To create a sibling category, just follow the same steps as above:
1. Enter the __Catalog__ module.
2. In the __Products Management__ tab options, click __Category__.
3. Click the highest level of categories (i.e., __Categories__).
4. Click __actions__.
5. Click __Include__.
6. Fill in the fields and save.

## Create a child category

A child category is one that is "inside" the parent category and therefore is a level below it.

Within the category *Women*, for example, we can define the category *Shirts*.

The steps needed to do that are almost identical to those listed above.

The only difference is that instead of clicking the highest-level category (__Categories__) and then __actions__, you must click the __Women__ category and then __ations__.

That is, this time the __actions__ button will act on the __Women__ category. And with that the new category to be included will stay within it, one level below.
