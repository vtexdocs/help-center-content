Once you create the product, it's time to create the first SKU to be part of this product.

If after filling in the fields of the [product registration](/en/getting-started/create-a-product) you click on __Save and register__, the screen that appears next will be the one for SKU registration.

But it's also possible to reach the SKU registration screen through the following path:
1. Go to the __Catalog__ module and on the __Product__ tab, hover over the __Products and SKUs__ option and click __Products and SKUs Management__.
2. Click the blue button arrow on the desired product line, and then the __SKU__ option.
3. Click the __New SKU__ button.

You will be taken to the SKU registration screen.

1. Fill in the __Name__ field with the name you want for this SKU.
2. In the __Reference Code__ field, enter a code for the SKU. For example, a blue shirt with size M might have the code __BLUE\_SHIRT\_M__. Normally this code is used as an ID for integrations with ERPs or as an identifier relevant to the operation of the store.
3. In the fields for freight dimensions, enter the information corresponding to the SKU in question (weight, height, width and length).
4. Make sure that the __Activate SKU if Possible__ flag is checked. It must be checked so that the SKU is displayed on the site.
5. Click __Save__.

All fields available on this screen are listed in the article [SKU registration fields](/en/tutorial/sku-registration-fields).

>ℹ️ Sometimes a product does not have variations that justify the creation of more than one SKU for it. In this case, there is no problem creating an SKU with the same product name. Just remember that you always need to create **at least one SKU for each product**.
