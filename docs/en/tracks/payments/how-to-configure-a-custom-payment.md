The **customized payment method** is an alternative to the options offered by default by the Payments module.

It is possible to customize payments within three categories: **Notes Payable**, **Store Cards (Own brand)**, and **Store Cards (Co-Branded)**.

Each category allows 5 configurations, totaling 15 possible customized payment alternatives.

## Notes Payable
A Note Payable is a promise of payment that needs manual approval of the seller to perform the transaction. It is often used to provide payment through money.

## Store Cards (Own Brand)
It allows the use of a store's credit card with its own brand.

## Store Cards (Co-Branded)
It allows the use of a store's credit card in partnership with one of the following networks: MasterCard, Visa, Amex and Diners.

## How to configure

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Select the **Custom Payments** tab.
3. Select one of the custom payment options.
4. Fill out the form fields and click on the **Save** button.

After this configuration, the creation of a [Payment Condition](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455) is required.

> _We recommend **using the automatic approval** only in cases where the payment will be made **upon delivery** or **pickup at the store**. This option releases the payment of the order, meaning that the order automatically switches to the Preparing Delivery status, without payment verification._
