The __Payments__ module allows several payment providers (gateways, acquirers, sub-acquirers, [orchestrators](https://www.y.uno/br), [PSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_service_provider), among others) to be configured in your store. This way, you can offer different payment methods and conditions to your customers.

When a purchase is made in your store and the customer makes payment, data transmission between VTEX and the chosen provider occurs through communication protocols configured in the VTEX Admin.

>ℹ️ To check which payment providers are available in your region and the respective settings articles, visit [List of payment providers by country](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/list-of-payment-providers-by-country--2im3BEGXxSAcRuxEaIHPvp).</p>

Below is an example of how to set up a payment provider:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payments > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New provider` button.
3. Type the desired payment provider in the search bar and click on its name.
4. Fill in the available fields according to information from the payment provider with which you have a contract.
5. Click `Save`.
