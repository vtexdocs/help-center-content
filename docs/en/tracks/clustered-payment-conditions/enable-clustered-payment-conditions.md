Currently, the feature is only available for VTEX clients using Customer Credit.

As a result, you need two steps to use it. The first is to enable Customer Credit by installing and configuring it. 

The second step is to configure the Clustered Payment Conditions in your store.

## Enable Customer Credit

>ℹ️ If Customer Credit is already installed and configured, jump to 
> "Enable Clustered Payment Conditions".

### 1. Installing the app

Customer Credit is available on [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/ "VTEX App Store"). You can also download it directly in your store’s Admin by accessing Account Settings > Apps > App Store.

For more details on how to install the Customer Credit app, read the first article in this tutorial on [how to get started with this app](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/customer-credit-como-comecar--1hCRg21lXYy2seOKgqQ2CC/36grlQ69NK6OCuioeekyCs "how to get started with this app").  

### 2. App Settings

You then need to configure the Customer Credit app to be used as a payment method.

There are some [basic settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/customer-credit-como-comecar--1hCRg21lXYy2seOKgqQ2CC/21ok0GBwmcIeaY2IukYMOg "basic settings") that every client should perform once installing the app for the first time. You must also [create customer accounts](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/customer-credit-como-comecar--1hCRg21lXYy2seOKgqQ2CC/7FHLd0cmxqqGeEUuc8uioU "create customer accounts") for those you want to offer credit to and set the respective [payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/customer-credit-como-comecar--1hCRg21lXYy2seOKgqQ2CC/21ok0GBwmcIeaY2IukYMOg#payment-conditions "payment conditions"). 

## Enable Clustered Payment Conditions in your store

>⚠️ This functionality is currently in Closed Beta (testing stage) and is not available for installation in new stores.  

Now that your store uses Customer Credit, you can enable Clustered Payment Conditions. Contact our support team, open a [ticket](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/abrir-chamados-para-o-suporte-vtex--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM "ticket") and ask for the feature to be enabled in your store.

Once enabled, Clustered Payment Conditions will be displayed as one of the special payment conditions options for Customer Credit.
