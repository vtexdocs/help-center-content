As mentioned, Clustered Payment Conditions establish that a payment condition will apply to one or more customers. 

> ⚠️ Previously configured payment conditions can apply to customer clusters. It means that you can edit existing payment conditions and apply clustering conditions to these rules.

Let’s take a look at how we should configure an exclusive payment condition for clusters.

> ❗ **Warning**: you can only create five client clusters for each payment condition.  

You can create a new payment condition by applying the clustering conditions. To do so, go to Admin > Payments > Settings > Payment Conditions.

Then click on the green "+" button on the right side of the screen and select the "Customer Credit" option. It will be in the "Other" section.

You will be redirected to the configuration page of the new payment condition. We explain how to fill in the fields on that page in our article on how to configure a payment condition in the Customer Credit Track.

When you finish configuring the rules for deadlines and installments, proceed to clustering:

1. Click on __Add special condition__;
2. Select the __Customer Clusters__ option;
3. Then, select whether the condition applies to __all or just to specific conditions__;
4. Fill in the first field with the __cluster you want to use__;
5. Select an __operator__;
6. In the last field, set the __value__ of the selected cluster. 

You can add more than one condition for each payment condition. 

If necessary, click on the "Add another Condition" button and repeat the steps above and then click on the __blue "Save" button__.

## Editing an existing payment condition

To edit an existing payment condition, go to Admin > Payments > Settings > Payment Conditions. 

Then, in the search bar on the top of the page, type "Customer Credit" and click on the payment condition you want to edit.

You will be directed to the configuration page of that specific payment condition.

Follow these instructions: 

1. Click on __Add special condition__;
2. Select the __Customer Clusters__ option;
3. Select whether the conditions applies to __all or to specific conditions__;
4. Fill in the first field with the __cluster you want to use__;
5. Select an __operator__;
6. In the last field, set the __value__ of the selected cluster. 

To add another condition, click on the "Add another condition" button and repeat the steps above, or finish by clicking on __the blue "Save" button__.
