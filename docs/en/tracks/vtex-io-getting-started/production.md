You are only 2 commands away from drawing live traffic to your app. __Tread carefully__!

## Production

Once you think your _workspace_ is behaving well and decide that it is time to __prepare it__ for production, you can put the workspace in [production mode](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-is-the-production-mode).

To do that, simply run:

`vtex production`

## AB Test
_Coming Soon_

## Promote

It's time to put your app to the test. By [promoting your workspace](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-does-promoting-a-workspace-mean), you are going to replace your current __master workspace__ with the current one. To do that, run:

`vtex promote`
