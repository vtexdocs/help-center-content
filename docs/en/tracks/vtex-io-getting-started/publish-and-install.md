If you want your app to be available in production, __linking it is not enough__. For that, the app needs to be __installed in master workspace__. But you will never be able to install an app that only exists in your local environment.

When you [publish](/en/faq/what-does-publishing-an-app-mean) an app, what you're doing is making it available for others to [install](/en/faq/what-does-installing-an-app-mean) it, including yourself.

## Publish

To publish the app to the Registry of the account you're working on, just use the following command:

`vtex publish`

## Install

Since you published your app without [Pricing Models](/en/tutorial/app-pricing-options), only your account can install it. To do so, just do:

`vtex install` if you are currently in the app's folder

or

`vtex install {vendor}.{appName}` if you are not.
