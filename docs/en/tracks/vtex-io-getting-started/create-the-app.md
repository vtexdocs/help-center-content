You are now ready to start developing your own [app](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-is-an-app)!

## Create the app's initial files

Every app in VTEX IO has a predefined [structure](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/how-is-the-structure-of-an-app). 

To create a basic default structure for folders and files, do the following:

- Create a new folder `mkdir newApp`
- Switch to it `cd newApp`
- Run `vtex init`

When using this command, the system will give you five options of initial default structures:
- graphql getting-started
- react+graphql
- hello graphql
- hello react
- dreamstore getting-started

The __react+graphql__ option is the most complex since it addresses front-end (React) and back-end (GraphQL) development.

For more information on the __Dream Store__, head over to it's Github [page](https://github.com/vtex-apps/dreamstore-getting-started)
