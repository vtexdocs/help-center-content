__VTEX IO__ is VTEX's web application development platform.

In this track, we will teach you step by step how to develop an app using VTEX IO.

## Basic Structure

See in the image below the hierarchical structure of VTEX IO:

![VTEX IO Hierarchy](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/44SdYX37X2WKa6gicUKQWS/4b699f3355a2d9d70126354578d285cd/VTEX_IO_-_track_img.png)

- __Account__: To develop an app, you need to have a VTEX account.
- __Workspaces__: These are the environments where the apps will be developed. These environments are linked to the account. You may have multiple workspaces for a single account.
- __App__: it's the application itself. Apps are developed within workspaces. Multiple apps can be developed within a single workspace.

## VTEX CLI

To get started, fist install the [VTEX CLI](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/vtex-io-toolbelt--sq7pQ21bqKa8QeQmmUKyG) using the package manager of your choice:

`npm i -g vtex`

or

`yarn global add vtex`

You can run `vtex -v` to check if it was successfully installed.

## Login
