In the cart, the sales associate can click on `Order Summary` and then on the customer's name. This gives them access to the customer's profile page, which contains the following information:

- Customer data, such as email, phone, document number and addresses
- Last cart created by the customer in the ecommerce
- Last orders

In the box showing the last cart, the sales associate can retrieve that cart with just one click on `Recover Cart`.

In the boxes of each of the last orders placed by the customer, the sales associate can copy the cart, by pressing `Copy Cart`.

Remember that all this information refers not only to the customer's experience in the current physical store, but also to that customer's interactions in the ecommerce or in any physical store where a sales associate has catered the customer with an VTEX Sales App app.
