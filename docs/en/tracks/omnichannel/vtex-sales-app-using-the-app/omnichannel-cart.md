Since consulting the catalog makes VTEX Sales App bring products not only from the local inventory but from the entire catalog shared between channels, the cart assembled with VTEX Sales App is omnichannel: it can contain products that exist in the store's local warehouse, but also others that exist in other warehouses.

It's as if the sales associate had access to the ecommerce checkout but also with access to the physical store's inventories. The VTEX Sales App checkout brings the same data you would have in ecommerce to the order context in the physical store:

- Catalog SKU data
- Promotions and gift cards from the promotions module
- Fulfillment prices and SLAs
- Payments module installments
- Logistics module delivery SLAs
- Fees
