> ℹ️ This section applies to stores using Store Framework (VTEX IO), Legacy CMS Portal or Headless CMS, but not to external stores, which receive a code to use the [Nizza](https://platform.nizza.com/login) platform.

When **Live Shopping** is successfully installed, it contains four pages in your VTEX Admin:

* Events
* Blocked words
* Global page
* Snack Size Videos

To check if the installation was done correctly, follow the instructions below for your store account type.

## General accounts

In your VTEX Admin, go to **Apps** and check if **Live Shopping** is visible, or type **Live Shopping** in the VTEX Admin global search at the top of the page. 

## Accounts using VTEX IO with Site Editor

To validate the installation, follow the steps below:

> ❗ Don't click `Save` during this steps. You should only do that when you're ready to start transmitting the event.

1. In **Site Editor**, navigate to the location where the Live Shopping block was installed (Home, Landing, or Category page).
2. Make sure the **Live Shopping** block is visible.
3. Click the **Live Shopping** block.
4. Check that the **Show component** option is displayed. The event must have been turned on in order to show here.
5. Toggle the **Show component** switch on.
6. Check if the **Live Shopping** component is correctly rendered in **Site Editor**. If the component is displayed correctly, this means the app was successfully installed.

## Testing the tool

We recommend creating a short 5-minute live stream with your team, and everyone who will be using **VTEX Live Shopping**, including creating, configuring and starting an event, as well as interacting in real time to ensure that all functionalities are installed correctly and work seamlessly with your account. This will help you:

* Gain a clear understanding of the **Live Shopping** functionalities.
* Have enough time to adjust information, products, and features.
* Identify and solve inconsistencies before a live event.

The objective is to identify possible blockers or challenges before a real live event. Make sure you create a landing page or workspace for the event and share it only with the people involved in the test.
