> ℹ️ This section applies to stores using Store Framework (VTEX IO), Legacy CMS Portal or Headless CMS, but not to external stores, which receive a code to use the [Nizza](https://platform.nizza.com/login) platform.

When **Live Shopping** is successfully installed, it contains four pages in your VTEX Admin:

* Events
* Block words
* Global page
* Snack Size Video

To verify if the installation was done correctly, follow the instructions below according to your store account type.

## General accounts

In your VTEX Admin, go to **Apps** and check if **Live Shopping** is visible, or simply type **Live Shopping** in the VTEX Admin global search on the top the page. 

## Accounts using VTEX IO with Site Editor

To validate the installation, follow the steps below:

> ❗ Don't click `Save` in this step by step, this must be done only when you're ready to start transmitting the event.

1. In the **Site Editor**, navigate to the location where the Live Shopping block was installed (Home, Landing, or Category Page).
2. Ensure the **Live Shopping** block is visible.
3. Click on the **Live Shopping** block.
4. Verify that the **Show Component** option is displayed. The event must have been turned on in order to appear in this part.
5. Turn on the **Show Component** switch.
6. Verify that the **Live Shopping** component is correctly rendered in the **Site Editor**. If the component is displayed correctly, it means the application has been successfully installed.

## Testing the tool

We encourage you to create a short 5mins live with your team, and all the people that will be using **VTEX Live Shopping**, that consists in creating, configuring and starting an event, with real time interaction to ensure that all functionalities are installed correctly and work seamlessly with your account. The main benefits are:

* Gaining a clear understanding of the **Live Shopping** functionalities.
* Having enough time to adjust information, products and features.
* Identifying and solving inconsistencies before a live event.

The objective is to identify possible blockers or challenges before a real live event. Make sure you create a landing page or workspaces to set the event and only share it with the people involved in the test.
