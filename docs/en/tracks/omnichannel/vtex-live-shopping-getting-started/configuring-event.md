In the VTEX Admin, when you go to **Apps > Live Shopping** and click the arrow icon of a [created event](/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/5WLXGbOSFmxN7QlzOnfGrv), you access its **Event Information** page, where you can set it up as explained in the following sections:

* [Layout type - Configuring the style](#layout-type-configuring-the-style)
* [Chat - Configuring the administrator name](#chat-configuring-the-administrator-name)
* [Settings - Configuring features](#settings-configuring-features)
* [CMS Configuration - Configuring content presentation](#cms-configuration-configuring-content-presentation)

> ⚠️ This article describes the main settings for an event. It doesn't cover all sections of the **Event Information** page. For more information, check [Live Shopping: Events article](/en/tutorial/live-shopping-events--6aGLiqoKG1UoS30f3FFWch).

## Layout type - Configuring the style

The layout defines the screen format seen by customers during the event transmission; therefore, it determines the event recording format.

> ❗ The broadcasting studio uses the layout of the first person who enters it. You must set up the event layout before entering the streaming studio. Even though you can change the layout through the VTEX Admin later, you can't change it within the streaming studio.

### Screen format

In the **Layout Type** section, you can choose the desired layout format for broadcasting the event from the following:

* **Landscape (16:9):** Provides a horizontal view of the transmission, optimized for desktop screens.
* **Portrait (9:16):** Provides a vertical view of the transmission, optimized for mobile screens.

![article_7_screen_format_EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tracks/omnichannel/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started/configuring-event_1.png)

The screen format is **Landscape (16:9)** by default, but you can change it by clicking the **Portrait (9:16)** view. The blue checkmark indicates the selected option.

> ℹ️ Note that once the transmission using Bundle studio starts, the screen layout can't be changed anymore. To change it, you would need to create a new event.

### Style customization

By default, an event has a neutral visual style that is suitable for stores and doesn’t affect brand image. However, if you want, you can customize the following styles:

* Text font
* Colors
* Product cards
* Product price
* Add to cart button
* Featured product
* Product section title
* Chat title
* Send message button

> ℹ️ The customizations above are made by clicking the **Customize the look and feel** button and completing the Look and Feel page to align with your preferences. For complete instructions, check [Live Shopping: Events](/en/tutorial/live-shopping-events--6aGLiqoKG1UoS30f3FFWch).

## Chat - Configuring the administrator name

The **Chat** section is where you manage the live chat during your event. If you want to configure a specific name to identify the administrator sending messages, follow the steps below:

1. In the **Chat** section, click the profile icon.
2. In the **Store Information** window, enter the desired administrator name in the box.
3. Click `Confirm`.

> ℹ️ To learn how to pin messages, block users, delete messages, and perform other actions in the event chat, check [Live Shopping: Events](/en/tutorial/live-shopping-events--6aGLiqoKG1UoS30f3FFWch).

## Settings - Configuring features

In the **Settings** section, you can enable or disable the following event features:

| **Topic** | **Feature** |
| :---: | :--- |
| Chat | <ul><li>**Email required:** By default, to allow the audience to participate in the live event chat, only their name is required. When you enable this field, they also have to provide an email address.</li><li>**Enable email sending:** When this field is enabled, if the audience asks a question and the administrator responds through the chat, an email notification is sent to the user with the response. This helps maintain the interaction with the end user outside the chat.</li></ul> |
| Player | <ul><li>**Viewer visibility:** Displays the number of viewers currently watching the live stream event. This number isn’t cumulative.</li><li>**Popup transmission:** Allows displaying the entire Live Shopping component (chat, player, and product sidebar) in a popup format, drawing the full attention of the audience while they’re watching the event. The audience can close the popup anytime by clicking the X in the corner to return to the normal format.</li></ul> |
| Products | <ul><li>**Apply tax:** Allows applying taxes to products showcased during the live event. When this option is enabled, the module **Promotions > Surcharges** will display the product price along with the applicable tax.</li></ul> |

## CMS Configuration - Configuring content presentation

In the **CMS Configuration** section, you can set up how the content will be presented during the event. The existing functionalities are the following:

* **Sidebar products:** Displays a sidebar that showcases a collection of products alongside the video player. The products are shown vertically on the left side of the player.
* **Product carousel:** Displays a carousel with a collection of products in a landscape view under the video player during the live event.
* **Chat:** Enables your audience to interact via chat during the live event. Note that if the chat is hidden, the question option will also be hidden, as this functionality is displayed above the chat.
* **Like:** Allows users to react during the live event using the heart-shaped like button.

![article_7_cms_configuration_EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tracks/omnichannel/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started/configuring-event_2.png)

* **Checkout cart:** Provides an `Add to cart` button that, when clicked by your audience, opens the checkout with the product added to the customer shopping cart in a new tab. The picture-in-picture (PiP) mode will also be activated, allowing the customer to continue watching the live stream while completing the purchase.
* **Quick view:** Allows your audience to view the live event while seeing product variations. When the customer clicks the `Add to cart` button, a quick product view opens up without hiding the event transmission. This allows the customer to choose the size and color of a product, for example, while still watching the event. 
    * If this option is disabled, when the customer clicks `Add to cart`, a new tab with the Product Details Page (PDP) opens and the PiP mode automatically activates so that the customer keeps watching the live stream.
* **Infinite scroll:** Implements an infinite scroll for the sidebar products option that automatically scrolls every N seconds, so that your audience can view all the products without any additional action. 
    * The automatic scroll speed is set to 10 seconds by default, but you can change it by entering the desired number in the field. We recommend configuring within 3 to 100 seconds.

> ℹ️ All the functionalities above are enabled by default, except **Product carousel** and **Checkout cart**.

### Script for template

To embed the live-streaming app in your storefront with your preferences, you can use the HTML tag found under the **Script for template** field. You must choose one of the following options:

* **CMS template:** For stores using Legacy CMS Portal.
* **External template:** For external stores.

### Preview

To have a preview of the event, in **Event Information > CMS Configuration**, click the `Preview` button. A new tab will open and play the event as your audience will view it. This simulation helps validate everything is working properly by displaying elements such as:

* Chat
* Player
* Product sidebar
* Product highlights

> ❗ We highly recommend doing additional checks on the entire website to ensure everything is working properly. The **Preview** checks only certain **Live Shopping** components.
