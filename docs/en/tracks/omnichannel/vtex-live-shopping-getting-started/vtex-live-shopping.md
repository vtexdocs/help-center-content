The [Live Shopping](/en/tutorial/live-shopping--1cYWPIbjNMyr072sksHSVL) app enables stores to create immersive, real-time shopping experiences directly on their storefronts. Merchants can live stream events on their store website to promote product collections, increase sales, and enhance user experience, while interacting via live chat.

This technical onboarding guide is designed to assist development and operations teams with implementing, configuring, and optimizing **Live Shopping**. The goal is to ensure a seamless setup and allow brands to host engaging, conversion-driven live events.

## Overview

* **Player**: Transmission display with options like full screen, likes, share, and Picture-in-Picture (PiP).
* **Product sidebar**: Displays up to 50 products during the event, with the possibility of highlighting products.
* **Chat**: Enables real-time interaction between administrators and store clients.
