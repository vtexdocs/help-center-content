The first step to live-streaming an event is to turn it on. This action won’t start the event transmission, but it will allow you to make all the necessary configurations.

> ⚠️ Before your store's first live event, we strongly recommend running a [test event](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/1le8tz3fyBdb7kR4UdxTjZ#testing-the-tool) to validate product setup, stream quality, and interactivity.

To turn an event on, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > Live Shopping > Events**, or type **Events** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the row of the event you want to activate, click the arrow button in the **Action** column.
3. On the **Event Information** page, at the top right, click the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on" aria-hidden="true"></i> toggle switch `Turn On` to activate the event. 

> ❗ After clicking **Turn on**, wait about three to five minutes for the event activation process to complete.

Once the **Turn on** switch is enabled, you can close the page if you want. Note that the event will automatically end after 1h30. This countdown automatically resets when you start transmitting. 

> For example, when you start an event, it won’t end automatically after the mentioned timeframe, but after you stop streaming, if no new transmission begins within 1h30, the event will be finalized.

## Event details

Once the event is turned on, all configurations become available for setup. In the **Details** section, you’ll see the following information:

| **Field name** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- |
| ID | Event ID, its unique identifier. |
| Event name | Name of the event. |
| UTM source | [UTM source](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-are-utm-source-utm-campaign-and-utm-medium--2wTz7QJ8KUG6skGAoAQuii) configured to track event data. |
| Minutes used | Transmission minutes elapsed, counted in real time. It only starts counting when the event broadcast begins. |
| Inbound server | Server code used to connect the event between different VTEX stores or other platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube. |
| Server key | Server key identification used to connect the event between different VTEX stores or other platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube. |

In this section, you can monitor the [event status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/5WLXGbOSFmxN7QlzOnfGrv#event-status), as shown in the image below:

> ⚠️ After turning on the event, if you don't transmit or interact with it for more than 90 minutes, the event status will change to `Completed`, meaning the event is finished and can no longer be broadcast.
