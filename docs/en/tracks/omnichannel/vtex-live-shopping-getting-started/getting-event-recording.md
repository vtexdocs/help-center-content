Once the transmission is over and the event reaches the `Completed` [status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-live-shopping-getting-started--3eCHNCIx8XhZOSmX0sQT3U/5WLXGbOSFmxN7QlzOnfGrv#event-status), you can access the live stream recording by following the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to the **Apps > Live Shopping > Events > Event Information** page.
2. In the **Event recording** section, you can select two options:
    * `Send to email`: You’ll receive a link to the recording in your email within 60 minutes.
    * `Download`: The recording file will be downloaded to your computer. The processing time depends on the event duration. You’ll be able to see the download progress.
3. Check your email, or the files downloaded to your computer, to access the event recording in `.mp4` format.

> ⚠️ Don't leave the page while downloading the event recording, otherwise the process will be interrupted.
