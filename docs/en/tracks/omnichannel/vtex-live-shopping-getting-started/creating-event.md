To create a new live-streaming event, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > Live Shopping > Events**, or type **Events** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click `New` to create a new live-streaming event.
3. In the **New Event** page, complete these fields with the following information:
    * **Event name:** The desired name for the event being created. We recommend using an easy identification.
    * **UTM source:** Tracking parameters added to your URL to help you track and analyze traffic from different sources. This is created by default according to the event name.
    * **(Optional) Collection ID:** The ID of the desired product collection to be attached to the live-stream event, up to 50 products per collection. During the event, these items can be displayed to customers via sidebar (default) and/or carousel, depending on your settings in the CMS Configuration section. 
    * **(Optional) Event time:** Information regarding the event date and time that helps to identify it easily on your **Events** list. This information is used to display upcoming events and has no impact on the current one. This field is not related to going live.
    * **(Optional) Event category:** Category of the event used to easily identify the event on your landing page. 
4. Click `Save changes`.

Once you’ve completed the steps above, the app will create the event, which will appear in the list of events on the **Events** page with the status `Created`.

## Event status

An event can have one of the following statuses:

| **Status** | **Description** |
| :---: | :--- |
| Created | Indicates that you’ve successfully created an event. |
| Starting | Indicates that you’ve turned on the event and it’s being processed to start live-streaming. This might take three to five minutes. |
| Live | The event is ready for you to:<ul><li>Configure all functionalities.</li><li>View the keys to live-stream from external studios and other platforms.</li><li>Start the Go live.</li></ul> |
| Completed | The event was finished and can no longer be transmitted. |
