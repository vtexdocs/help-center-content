After identifying the customer, the sales associate is taken directly to the cart. There, if you are using the desktop version of VTEX Sales App, connected to a barcode reader, simply beep the products and they will appear in the cart.

If the sales associate is using a tablet or smartphone, they will see a barcode button <i class="fas fa-barcode"></i> on the top bar of the application.

When clicking on it, the sales associate can use the camera to beep a product and, with that, be automatically taken to the details screen of that product.
