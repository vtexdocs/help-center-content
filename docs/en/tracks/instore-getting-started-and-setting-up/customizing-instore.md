The VTEX Sales App experience is customizable: you can enable specific features and settings to suit your business needs, and you can also adapt the app layout to match your brand identity.

This requires editing JavaScript and CSS files, as described in the [How to customize VTEX Sales App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/how-to-customize-vtex-sales-app) developer guide.

>⚠️ Only people with programming experience should customize VTEX Sales App as incorrect changes to these files can cause critical errors.
