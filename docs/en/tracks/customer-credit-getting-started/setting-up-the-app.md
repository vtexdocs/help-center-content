## App settings

Then, still on the same VTEX Admin screen(__Apps > Customer Credit > Settings__), you should check the following settings options:

- [Tolerance](#tolerance)
- [Automatic account creation](#automatic-account-creation) 
- [My Credits page](#my-credits-page)
- [Payment instructions](#payment-instructions)
- [Identifying Information](#identifying-information)

### Tolerance

Activating this option allows a purchase to be completed even if its value exceeds the customer's available credit limit. When creating an account, it is possible to register an excess credit percentage (tolerance) for each customer.

For example, for an account created with a credit limit of $1,000.00 and a tolerance of 10%, the customer will be able to place an order with a maximum value of $1,100.00 using Customer Credit as a payment method. If the customer wishes to use the credit to pay for an order worth $1,250.00, the system will not allow the purchase to be completed.

>⚠️ Tolerance values are configured in decimal numbers, with 0 representing 0% and 1 representing 100%. Example: to use a tolerance of 5%, the value to be configured is 0.05.

### Automatic account creation

This option allows any store customer to use Customer Credit as a payment method, even if you have not previously created an account for them in the Customer Credit app. When activating this functionality, you must also define the initial credit limit that can be used for orders placed by customers without a Customer Credit account.

### My Credits page

By installing the __My Credits__ page, you will allow customers to view and manage information about the credits and titles available in their account.

The customer can access this page on your store's website at __My account > My Credits__.

### Payment Instructions 

This configuration allows you to insert instructions related to payment in the invoices issued by Customer Credit. To edit the message to be displayed in the invoice, enter the information in the test box and click `Update`.

>⚠️ The message registered in this configuration will be replicated on all invoices issued for all Customer Credit accounts. It is not possible to configure a unique message for each specific customer or invoice.
