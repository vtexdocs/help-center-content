Message-to-Order is a Conversational Commerce solution by VTEX that allows customers to use WhatsApp as a new shopping channel. With its fully automated experience integrated into the VTEX environment, customers can purchase using a shopping list, making it an ideal solution for customers in the Grocery, Pet, and B2B industries. In addition to allowing faster purchasing through automation and using **natural language processing** (NLP), customers can also use the product to request live support. 

To leverage human support, Message-to-Order is already pre-integrated with Zenvia (Zenvia Chat product) and Zendesk marketplace platforms. Customers without these platforms or those who won't offer human support can be redirected to the brand's standard support channels via customized messages.

>ℹ️ Message-to-Order is still in its early stages of operation (alpha phase), and therefore, its scope is limited.  Currently, its customer base and markets are limited to Brazil and Latin America, and only a limited set of features are available.
