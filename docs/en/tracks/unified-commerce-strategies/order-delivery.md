Deliveries are made when customers opt to have their orders delivered to a specific address, such as their homes.

See two examples of this scenario:

* A customer makes a purchase on ecommerce and chooses to receive the order at home.
* A customer makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store via [Endless Aisle](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/40KMlmGI5tN0r0KPCDWgGn) — when the item is not available in the store’s inventory — and chooses to have the order delivered to their home.

In this case, items usually come from the warehouse of a distribution center, as illustrated below.

Another shipping possibility that can optimize your store’s operation and reduce costs is implementing the [Ship From Store](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/50GAmxxFsJoLWqcnMysWdl) strategy. This strategy refers to in-store fulfillment, meaning items can also be shipped from physical stores' inventories.

To configure the shipping strategy, see our walkthrough on [Inventory & Shipping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/logistica-101--13TFDwDttPl9ki9OXQhyjx/7k4SWtm3EIvLQ3aGXWC07).
