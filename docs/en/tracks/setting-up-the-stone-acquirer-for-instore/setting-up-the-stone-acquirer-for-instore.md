To allow transactions through card machines using inStore, you need an acquirer or sub-acquirer that will process your payments.

__Stone__ is an inStore certified sub-acquirer in Brazil.

>⚠️ If you want to use Stone in a different country or if you want to use another acquirer which is not currently certified, you will need to build the integration with that acquirer’s application. To do so, refer to the article [Integrating inStore to a new payment acquirer](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-integration--6NTqymtXmL9cNy8w1ouAod).

>ℹ️ Stone is currently supported only by **Android** systems, with **Gertec GPOS700** card machines. For other card machines, Stone recommends that you use [Pagar.me acquirer](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-payments--43B4Nr7uZva5UdwWEt3PEy/1obqdkoH82yFWtaMbwcJKx).

Before installing Stone’s application, make sure you have completed the previous step of setting up the Payments module.
