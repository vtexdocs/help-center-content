There are two of adding a price rule:

- through the Admin
- by API REST

Follow the steps below to add a price rule to your store:

## Admin

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Prices > Price rules**, or type **Price rules** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on the green **New Rule** button.
3. In the first step, **What is the general data of this rule?**, select a trade policy from the *dropdown menu*.
4. In the second step, **What items will this rule apply to?**, choose whether the rule will apply to *all products* or *only to chosen categories and brands*. If you select the second option, you should also choose the **Categories** and/or desired **Brands**.
5. In the third step, **Apply rule to items within a markup range?**, switch the *toggle* to yes to make use of the markup range. Type in the markup's minimum percentage in the **From** field and its max percentage in the **up to** field to select items within this range.
6. In the next step, **Select timeframe to apply this rule in?**, switching the *toggle* to yes will allow you to use this criteria. Choose the **Start Date**, **Start Hour**, **End Date** and the **End Hour** to define the period in which this rule will be applied.
7. In the final step, **What will the price change for this rule be?**, set the price percentage *modifier*. The price rule will apply this modifier to the selected SKUs.
8. Click on **Save**
9. A *sidebar* to confirm the new rule will appear. Click on **Confirm**.

## API REST

>⚠️ Authentications for Prices module's API REST calls should be done using AppKey and AppToken. For more info, read our article on [how to generate an AppKey and AppToken to authenticate integrations](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/getting-started-authentication)

To add a **price rule**, you need to send a __POST__ to the following endpoint:

`https://api.vtex.com/{{accountName}}/pricing/pipeline/catalog`

- The request object has the following properties:

|------------------|-----------|-------------|
