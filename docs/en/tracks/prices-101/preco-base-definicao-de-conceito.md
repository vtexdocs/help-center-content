## Definition

A SKU's base price is the value which results from merging the **Cost Price** with the **Markup**, the desired profit margin with the SKU's sale. It represents the SKU's __reference price__ for all price tables. 

![base-price-en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/cbmJa638a5NuZHtjF1FPN/4bb70f39b01a19c15ec07525e8372329/base-price-en.png)

This **base price** can be combined with a price table's applied **price rule**. If there are no registered price rules, a price table's selling price will be equal to the base price itself.

## List Price

The __list price__ functions as a SKU's suggested selling price. Later on, this price can receive a reduction, allowing you to showcase a SKU with the following information in the store's window display:

```
Original Price: U$ 199,00
Sales Price: U$ 149,00
```

Thus, the list price is the **original price** and the selling price is the __sales price__. 

## Examples

As previously mentioned, the base price is the *reference price* for all your store's price tables. 

In the article on the Prices module architecture, we saw that if you *only* add a SKU base price without configuring other rules or fixed prices, that base price value will be considered the __computed price__ for your price tables.

If your strategy does not entail having different prices for different contexts, you just have to add one base price for your SKUs.
