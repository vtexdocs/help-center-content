VTEX Support is provided online and allows you to open tickets with different priority levels, depending on your store location. Tickets can be opened on the [support page](https://help.vtex.com/en/support), which requires [user account authentication](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4EPwTXx5oFdSG1dA3zIchz#setting-roles-and-permissions-for-users). Three authentication methods are available:

- Token received via the email added to the store.
- Login using a Google account.
- Email and password with two-factor authentication via app or SMS.

>⚠️ To get authentication authorization, the [user](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-users--tutorials_512) must have access to the VTEX Admin and a [role ](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc)
>  associated with [License Manager resources. ](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3).

VTEX Support is divided in regions, and each region has its own service level agreement (SLA), priority, and Customer Excellence (CX) team available for that region. These are the regions where support operates:

- Brazil
- Latin America (LATAM, except Brazil)
- Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- United States (US)
- Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA)
