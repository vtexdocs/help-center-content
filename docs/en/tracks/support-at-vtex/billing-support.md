After [joining VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4EPwTXx5oFdSG1dA3zIchz), clients may have questions related to changing their account details, billing information, invoices, and other billing aspects of the account. To address these, billing support is available to help with contractual and billing issues related to stores and VTEX.

You can start by exploring the [Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/pt/) articles and by checking the topics below.

## Accounts payable

VTEX is committed to ensuring compliance with the procedures and policies for payments to suppliers of its branches. To do so, VTEX has implemented location-specific practices that suppliers need to follow:

- [Accounts Payable - Brazil](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/contas-a-pagar-brasil--tutorials_660): Practices to follow in all payments to suppliers related to the accounts payable procedures of VTEX branches in Brazil.

- [Accounts Payable - International](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/accounts-payable-international--3yea9sIlsA0KgUC28ASCGs): Practices to follow for all payments to suppliers related to the accounts payable procedures of VTEX branches outside Brazil.

>ℹ️ To check the list of VTEX international offices and to find out in which country the invoice is issued, see the [Names of VTEX branches worldwide](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/names-of-vtex-branches-worldwide--zg05n6OIOZOEmLW7dcq9z) article.

Revenue refers to orders with the `Approved orders` status on the [Order Details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/order-details-page--2Y75n54Cc9VizrlG1N6ZNl). Once an order is financially approved, the invoice reflects the total amount, including shipping and taxes. This is regardless of subsequent cancellations due to using the platform's infrastructure.

Through the **Orders module**, you can also download the financial report and view the invoice details and the approved revenue.

For more information, read the articles [What does VTEX consider as revenues for invoice calculation?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-does-vtex-consider-as-revenue-in-the-billing-calculation--58j4cfoXfisWyemASACwSq) and [Understanding the value of approved revenues](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-the-value-of-approved-revenues--tutorials_4322).
