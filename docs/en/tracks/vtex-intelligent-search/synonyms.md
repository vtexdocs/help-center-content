The Synonyms feature allows you to add synonyms - words with the same meaning - to a specific search term, increasing the chance of a successful search. This tool enables the merchant to create relationship rules between searched words and words contained in their product catalog.

The centralized management of these rules between related words automatically forms a dictionary for the entire catalog of products in the store.

Synonyms also complement search reports without results. From this analysis, the user can identify and take actions on which terms need synonyms in their dictionary.

Accordingly, VTEX Intelligent Search receives the term searched by the customer and searches for it in the synonym rules registered in its database. In case there is a rule, these words will be directed to the search within the catalog.
This way, if there is a synonym rule, no matter how the customer searches or how the product name is registered, they will always find what they are looking for.

>⚠️ Synonyms should not be used to correct spelling, plural and singular errors or even pronouns, articles and prepositions errors in the searched terms. VTEX Intelligent Search can automatically interpret, learn and solve all these cases through algorithms.

## Types of synonyms

There are two types of synonyms that can be created: Unidirectional or Bidirectional. See below the meaning of each one.

- **Unidirectional**: this option defines that the search for a word must return results that include one or more correlated words. This is usually used when the word's meaning encompasses more specific variations and, due to a strategic business decision, it is not interesting that the inverse equivalence is established.
    Example: when the customer performs a search with the term “smartphone”, the results can also be extended to “iphone”, if configured. But the opposite would not apply; when searching for "iphone", "smartphone" will not be displayed.

- **Bidirectional**: this option defines that two or more words have the same meaning.
    Example: if the customer searches for "diet" products, the results will also include products defined as "zero sugar" or "sugar-free", if they were configured. In the same way, when searching for "zero sugar", products defined as "diet" and "sugar-free" would be displayed.

## Examples

In a store, the products are registered as "television", but it is common for customers to search for "tv". You can configure that when the term “tv" is searched, televisions are displayed.
