The **Redirects** feature directs customers to another page, either internal or external to the store. This redirection is done in the search area of your storefront, using terms or filters selected by the customer. This way, one of the advantages of the Redirects feature is to contemplate communication scenarios that are not covered by the store's catalog search, such as redirecting a search for a brand to its promotional page.

>⚠️ This feature is available in VTEX Intelligent Search: Multilanguage. To learn more, please refer to our article VTEX Intelligent Search: Multilanguage settings (Beta).

## How redirects work

When creating a redirect, you also need to create conditions, called rules. They must contain a set of registered terms and filters. The number of rules per redirect is unlimited.

With this feature, you can create rules that contemplate both the interests of the manager and the final customer. Other benefits are:

- Increasing the search possibilities for the website. Searches without results statistically generate a bounce rate, which is the percentage of visitors who enter an ecommerce website and leave without seeing other pages.
- Facilitating the end-customer's usability, as in post-purchase situations or promotional actions.

Once the customer performs a search, VTEX Intelligent Search captures the search term and checks if there is a redirection rule related to that search.

The search term is eligible when there is at least one existing rule for it. This redirects the client to the registered URL.

If the customer searches for "my orders" or "orders", you can create a redirect that directs them to the orders in their account instead of displaying an empty search page.

You can also configure the tool to redirect the customer to a landing page for specific promotions. In this case, if the customer searches for "Black Friday", they will be redirected to the promotion.

In another scenario, if the customer searches for "running shoes" and filters for the brand Nike, they will be redirected to a dedicated page for the brand.
