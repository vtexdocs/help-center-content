Banners is the Intelligent Search feature that displays banners, like promotional activities, on the search results page of the customer. The banner display is based on an analysis of the search context, including selected terms and filters, in the buyer’s journey. Banners can also be configured for each existing category in your catalog, as well as for departments and subcategories.

Each customer group in your store, having its own profile, has its own interest. Your marketing campaigns need to take this into account in order to be effective and increase the sales conversion rate. The flexible settings of banners allow you to create marketing campaigns that are more creative, working your brand’s relationship with the public on an individual level.

It is worth noting that these settings can be configured by terms as well as by filters used during the search. If a customer searches for “running shoes,” they can filter by different attributes (“size,” “type,” and “brand”) in the search results. When the “nike” filter is selected, if there is a banner of that brand in the store, it can be displayed to the customer (filter).

Based upon the context captured by Intelligent Search, the system chooses the content, previously added, that is most relevant in that situation.

For example, consider that the customer searches for "running shoes", and in the search results they can filter by several attributes ("size", "type" and "brand"). When selecting the “nike” filter, in case there is a campaign of this brand in the store, it can be displayed to the customer (filter). The customer can also be directed to a more specific promotion of Nike running shoes (term and filter), if you've created a campaign and linked it to the banner.
