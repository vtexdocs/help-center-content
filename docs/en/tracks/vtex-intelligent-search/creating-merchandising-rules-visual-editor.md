### Adding filters and conditions

Filters are predefined selectable attributes that narrow the search results, such as filtering for all products in a category or brand, among other conditions. You can add one or more conditions to a filter.

To add a condition using the Visual Editor, follow the steps below.

1. Click `Filter`.
2. Click `+ Add condition`.
3. Fill in the desired conditions. The available options are detailed in [Merchandising rule conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3Dvava8LSVcFKeS2S6J7XW).
4. Click `Save`.

The defined conditions can work together (`and`) or alternatively (`or`).

In the <i class="far fa-ellipsis-v"></i> menu of each existing condition, you can `Duplicate` or `Delete` the condition. To deactivate all created conditions, click `Clear filters`.
