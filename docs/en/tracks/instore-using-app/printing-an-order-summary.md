When an order is placed using VTEX Sales App, it is possible to print the order summary if this customization is enabled and if there is a correctly configured printing device.

To do this, the sales associate can click on the `Print order` button on the completed order screen, as illustrated below. Another option is to configure VTEX Sales App to print the order summary automatically as soon as an order is placed.

To enable order summary printing, follow the steps below.

## 1. Customizing VTEX Sales App

First, your store developers must follow the instructions in [Set up order summary printing](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/set-up-the-order-summary-printing) to enable this customization.

## 2. Configuring the printer device in VTEX Sales App

Next, you must configure a printer connected to VTEX Sales App to print order summaries.

### Prerequisites

To pair VTEX Sales App with a printer, the following prerequisites must be met:

* Using computer with Windows 7 or higher operating system.
* Having VTEX Sales App installed on your computer. If you do not have it, you must install the app by following our [Installation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-using-the-app--4BYzQIwyOHvnmnCYQgLzdr/2rPSJ8519UCCZo5uEBkqxh) guide.
* Obtaining a pair of credentials (AppKey and AppToken) with the corresponding access permissions. For more information, please refer to the article [Application keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet).

>ℹ️ We recommend that the access profile associated with these credentials be the **VTEX Sales App Sales Person**. However, you can also use a profile with access to other Admin modules, such as **Super Admin**.

### Step-by-step instructions

After obtaining the AppKey and AppToken, follow the steps below.

1. Connect your printer via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB to the computer on which VTEX Sales App is installed.
2. Open the VTEX Sales App app and enter the name of the store where you want to configure the printer.
3. In the VTEX Sales App main menu, go to **Settings** and click on the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> **Configure device** option, as shown below.
