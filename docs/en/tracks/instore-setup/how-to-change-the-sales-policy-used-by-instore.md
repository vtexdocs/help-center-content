If you have set up your store using the __Easy Setup__ flow, a store for you has already been created in the __Stores Admin__ within VTEX VTable (https://{{AccountName}}.myvtex.com/admin/vtable).

![inStore aplicacoes vtable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tracks/instore-setup/how-to-change-the-sales-policy-used-by-instore_1.png)

Click __Stores Admin__ to open the table where you will see the physical stores.

If you have not used the __Easy Setup__ and so don't see any registered stores, create a new store by clicking on __New Line__ and register all the information including the sales policy that will be used for inStore. In that case, then associate the created store ID with the sellers you want to register. [Check out the step for vendors registration](/en/tracks/instore-setup?step=2).

If you have already registered a store through __Easy Setup__, you will see the registry of this store created as in the following image.

To change any data, including the store's sales policy, simply change the related cell and then click the __Save__ button.

In the devices using inStore, simply log out and then login back in again with the vendors associated with that store. The new sales policy will already be valid.
