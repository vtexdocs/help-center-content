## Which acquirers does the solution work with?
All acquirers integrated with Software Express (Ex: Stone, Elavon, Cielo, Rede, etc.) and Cappta.

## Does inStore have a barcode reader?
InStore can be integrated with any barcode reader or use tablet or smartphone cameras to scan.

## Is the solution integrated with VTEX’s platform?
Yes. Retailers will have the entire VTEX back-office connected to their physical stores: Orders, Payment gateway, Logistics and the rest.

## Is it compatible with electronic invoices?
Yes. You will be able to easily issue invoices after integrating our solution with your ERP system. 

## How much does inStore cost?
The price is defined with the commercial team and varies according to the project.

## Do I need to have a VTEX online store to use inStore?
No. You can use inStore without having an ecommerce on VTEX, but the data must be integrated with VTEX’s platform.
 
## What equipment is needed to use inStore?
Any tablet or smartphone running Android (6.0 or 7.0) or iOS (9 or 10), computers running Windows (from 7 on), and credit and debit card machines. We also recommend using a barcode reader to streamline the sales process.

## How can I acquire the devices? Do you sell or rent them?
 
The equipment can be purchased directly from the manufacturers. Thus, the shop owner can negotiate special conditions directly with manufacturers and buyers.

## Can I use inStore in events?
Yes. InStore is small, mobile, and practical. So it is very easy to sell products anywhere.

## Is it safe to use inStore?
Yes. InStore and its compatible hardware use the best security practices with encryption to send all the purchases’ data, and all data saved on the phone is accessible only through the inStore app. Still, for performance and security reasons, we recommend not installing apps other than the ones of the phone's operating system.

## Do I need to have Internet access to use inStore?
Yes, Internet access is important for purchases to be registered correctly on VTEX’s servers, allowing you to use all the advantages of VTEX’s platform.

## What are the recommended internet and infrastructure specifications?
Minimum specifications:
- Router with 2.4Ghz connection standard (802.11 N) and 20 Mbp device’s connection with the router
- Internet with link speed = 2 Mbps (reaching the device, in other words, what appears in the speed test on the smartphone)
 
Recommended specifications:
- Router with 5.0Ghz (802.11 AC) connection standard (the smartphone must be dual-band) and 40 Mbps device’s connection with the router 
- Internet with link speed = 5 Mbps (reaching the device, in other words, what appears in the speed test on the smartphone)

## What if my smartphone or card payment machine is stolen?
Just notify VTEX. The seller associated with the inStore app on that phone will be removed, and the hardware key will be reset, preventing any action with inStore to be performed.
