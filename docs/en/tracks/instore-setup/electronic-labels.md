Companies that work with the same price in e-commerce and in the physical stores find it difficult to keep prices synchronized on both channels. This is because price updating in e-commerce can be done with one click, but changing prices on the physical store usually involves more work (printing the new price and having someone else responsible for changing it).

The proposal of Electronic Tags is to make the physical store price update as easy as in e-commerce, and it is already available for VTEX stores.

We currently offer this feature in conjunction with SEAL, our partner that provides label hardware. Most of the configuration process is done by them. However, for them to consume your store's data, you need to complete two steps in VTEX Admin:

- [Creating appKeys and appTokens to authenticate integrations](/en/tutorial/creating-appkeys-and-apptokens-to-authenticate-integrations)
- [Configuring affiliates](/en/tutorial/configuring-affiliates)
