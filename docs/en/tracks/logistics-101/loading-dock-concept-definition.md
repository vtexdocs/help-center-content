## Definition	

A loading dock is a logistics step. Together with the warehouse and carrier, it makes up a store's logistics route. 

Its function is to forward stored SKUs from a store's warehouse to its carriers. It's where carriers load and distribute SKUs to their respective destinations. 

Within the steps that make up a store's logistics, the loading dock is directly relates to a specific Trade Policy. That's because each loading dock works with its own warehouse and carriers, thereby being the common ground between the steps of a logistics route.

## Relationship between Warehouse and Loading Dock

The warehouse and loading dock are different but intertwined logistics steps. Just as the warehouse, the loading dock is a physical space. However, the difference is that SKUs are stored for much less time time in loading docks.

The idea is for the loading dock to be a temporary storage space, in which SKUs are kept only until carriers arrive to ship them.

## Loading dock models
The is no universal logistics route model. A store can have two warehouses with three loading docks, for example. Or the loading dock can also function as a distribution center while inventory passes through. Everything depends on what benefits to your store's sales strategy more. 

## Examples

### Fair
Let's suppose that a farm sells fruits and vegetables to various locations from the capital, including restaurants, supermarkets and 7-elevens. 

In this case, the farm's own storage acts as a warehouse. However, since demand is very high, it needs to implement loading docks as distribution centers. For example, two loading docks can be present: one just for fruits and the other for vegetables.

Each location must envision the next step in its logistics route. For a fair wanting to spare expenses, it may entertain the possibility of contracting just one carrier to handle goods from both loading docks.

## Winery
A family owning a vineyard produces three types of wines: red, rose and white. These products are sold by three different resellers, each buying just one of the three available types. In this case, the family can decide to use just one loading dock to store all the wines and contract three carriers to handle shipping, one for each reseller.
