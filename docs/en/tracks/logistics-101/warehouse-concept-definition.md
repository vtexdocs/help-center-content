## Definition

The warehouse is an e-commerce's storage space for its goods, also called SKUs in VTEX's context.

Store items are stored using this space, ready to be distributed for delivery after confirmation of payment for the order closed by the client. New SKUs are also received in a warehouse, in addition to order being separated when ready for delivery.

## Relationship between Distribution Center and Warehouse 

As we've previously seen, most Distribution Centers are divided between warehouse and loading dock. 

However, this structure is not unique. The way in which these two elements are used in a distribution center's physical space depends on each store's reality.

For small businesses, the distribution center can be consist of only a warehouse. Since the order flow is low, a single warehouse shed is enough to store all the goods and organize them into orders.

Consequently, carriers can pick up packages directly from the warehouse, which cancels out the need for a loading dock.

The scenario changes according to the increase in the order flow. The more orders, the greater the need for loading docks to increase the flow of goods to carriers, for example.

## Example 

### Furniture store
 
 Because these goods are large in size, distribution centers need a lot of space to accommodate them.

There are several ways to organize the logistics behind this, one being to separate the warehouses into streets, where each stores a different piece of furniture.

Thereafter, once these pieces are collected, it is important to have a specific place for putting orders together.

Furthermore, it is up to tenants to consider whether just one loading dock is enough to handles all orders.
