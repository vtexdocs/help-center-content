Inventory is the feature for managing products available for sale. Once [products have been added](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/product-registration-fields--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke) to the [catalog](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalogo-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3rA2tTpIoEXdv2nzC27zxR), they must be listed in a warehouse to become available for sale. The [Inventory management](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-stock-items--tutorials_139) module is where catalog items are associated with a warehouse.

>ℹ️ Remember to add at least one [warehouse](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/warehouse--6oIxvsVDTtGpO7y6zwhGpb) in your store before using the [Inventory](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-stock-items--tutorials_139).

In the inventory, retailers can see:

* Item availability
* The warehouse in which the item is stored
* Item update history
* [Reserved](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-does-reservation-work--tutorials_92) items

To add items in bulk to the inventory, use the inventory template to import them. Learn more in the article [Importing and exporting an inventory spreadsheet](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/importing-and-exporting-an-inventory-spreadsheet--tutorials_2034).

Use the [critical inventory level alert](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/setting-up-the-critical-stock-alert--6FD0GHeQPCsKIMgkQ88SGu) to receive notifications when an item is almost out of stock.

>ℹ️ You can also set up your inventory via the [ Inventory API.](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/inventory)
