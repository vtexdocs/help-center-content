After an order has been added and its payment has been authorized, it makes its way to the end user. Three steps are necessary to guide along the way and ensure the delivery's success by understanding the logistics route of a VTEX store.

The logistics flow start with the inventory, on through the warehouse docks, then onto the carriers with deliver the SKUs to their destination address, thereby completing the process.

Each step is detailed below.

### Warehouse
An e-commerce's storage space for goods, which we also call SKUs in our present VTEX context. This space is used for storing store items that will be distributed for delivery, after the payment for the order to which they belong is approved. A warehouse is used for receiving new SKUs and to separate orders that are ready for delivery.

### Loading Docks
A loading dock is used to load and unload deliveries that go out for delivery. It's where orders are carried in the carrier's delivery vehicles. Loading docks function as an exit portal that allows orders to head on out to their end users. A warehouse with a loading dock make up a distribution center, where goods are stored and prepared for delivery.

### Carrier
A carrier is used to distribute orders to the their respective end users and is comprised of a fleet of vehicles that will perform the actual deliveries. The distribution center sends orders out for delivery directly to the carrier that will be used to complete the process until its final destination.
