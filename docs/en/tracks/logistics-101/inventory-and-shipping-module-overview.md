>ℹ️ Warning: This documentation is being updated to reflect the concept change from Pannels to [shipping strategy](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/estoque-e-entrega-entenda-o-que-mudou-na-aba-paineis--1YNfaeNG206XKI2UbGBRSl).

The __Inventory and Shipping__ module is the service responsible for your store's *logistics*. This system is used when adding __logistics route__ data that is used when delivering orders. In addition, you must use this module to __manage your inventory__, add __shipping prices__ and __shipping deadlines__ for each delivery type.

The logistics system has several useful functionalities. These *features* allow you to come up with a shipping and inventory strategy tailored to your business. In this track's next steps, we'll have a closer look at each one of the functionalities highlighted below. In your store's admin, you'll come across the following sections:

__Shipping strategy__ (Dashboard) - This section allows you to add logistics routes used for order shipping. A basic route consists of a __warehouse__,  a __loading dock__ and a __shipping policy__ (carrier).

__Shipping rates__ - This section allows you to manage and edit your carrier's shipping costs.

__Shipping simulator__ - This functionality allows you to simulate the specific order's shipping. You must input the order's shipping conditions, such as __ZIP Code__, __products__ and __sales channel__, so that the system can show available carrier options and their cost. 

__Inventory__ - This area allows you to manage SKUs in inventory, in addition to controlling and updating each item's __available quantity__ in a store's various warehouses.

__Geolocation shipping__ - If you don't want to use a ZIP code as shipping information, you can display a map during the *checkout*, allowing your clients to select the region where they want to receive their order.

__Holidays__ - This section allows you to add the holidays that affect your order shipping operation. Days registered as holidays will not be considered as working days when calculating shipping time.

__Settings__ - This area gives you access to some general logistics module settings, such as additional shipping costs, critically low inventory alerts, and pickup points display settings.

__Pickup Points__ - Lastly, we have the section where you can add pickup points. This * feature * allows your customers to pick orders up from stores, lockers and any other physical points, lowering shipping cost  and increasing your distribution capacity.
