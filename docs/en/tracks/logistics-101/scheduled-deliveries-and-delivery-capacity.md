A VTEX store can offer scheduled deliveries to its customers. With this option, customers can choose a specific day to receive their orders at a given address. 

To offer [scheduled deliveries](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/scheduled-delivery--22g3HAVCGLFiU7xugShOBi), you must add delivery windows to the [shipping policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-policy--tutorials_140) of the [carrier](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/carries-on-vtex--7u9duMD5UQa2QQwukAWMcE) in question. Once this is done, the periods and days available for this type of delivery will be displayed at your store's checkout.

Please note that the availability of scheduled deliveries depends on the services offered by the contracted carrier to your store, as defined in the shipping policy. You can track the availability of delivery windows and the number of items/orders that can still be placed in each delivery window on the [Delivery capacity](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-delivery-capacity--2y217FQZCjD0I1n62yxVcz) page.
