A pickup point is a physical place from where customers can retrieve their packages by themselves. It is an optional step that closes the logistics route. 

>ℹ️ The functionality of pickup points is only available to accounts that already use **Checkout V6**.


## Relationship with the carrier

Every pickup point necessarily needs to be linked to a carrier, which is done when adding that carrier.

This will enable ZIP codes that are served by the carrier and that are set in the shipping spreadsheet to also be served by the pickup points linked to that carrier. 

When linking a pickup to a carrier, you are in fact telling the system that the delivery addresses it serves are the same as those served by the pickup point.

## Pickup from store examples scenarios

Many retailers use their stores as pickup points. This allows customers to physically go to the store and pick up their order. 

There are cases in which all brick-and-mortar stores belonging to a network are used as pickup points. In such cases, it's up to customers to decide which store to go to and pick up their products.

However, another possible scenario is that of a single brick-and-mortar store acting as a pickup point, in which case this store would concentrate all orders made through e-commerce.
