There are two ways of adding a loading dock:

- Through Admin
- By API REST

Follow the steps below to add a loading dock to your store:

## Admin

1. Go to **Inventory & Shipping**;
2. Select the **Shipping Strategy**;
3. Click on **new loading dock**;
4. Fill out the data entry fields. For more details on each field's meaning, refer to section [data entry fields](#data-entry-fields) below.;
5. **Save** changes.

### Data entry fields

- _ID_: loading dock ID. If left blank, an automatic value will be attributed. 
- _Name_: loading dock name, for internal store use.
- _Trade policy_: trade policies served by this loading dock.
- _Associated carriers_: carriers served by this loading dock.
- _Processing time_: time that will added to the delivery due to the step involving this loading dock. For example, a processing time of 2 days plus a loading dock processing time of 3 days plus the carrier's processing time of 1 day means the delivery will be done in 6 days. 

>ℹ️ **Warning**: the processing time of a loading dock is independent of whether a carrier operates - or not - on weekends and holidays. Delivery time will always be the sum of inventory, carrier, and loading dock time.

- _Time overhead_: value that will be used to choose the best dock for a specific delivery. This value is added to the delivery time calculation.
- _Priority_: Value to settle loading dock selection stalemates. The higher a loading dock's priority, the more chances it has of being chosen. 
- _Endpoint WMS_: used to integrate an external WMS (warehouse management system) software with the orders processing flow.
- _Address_: loading dock address

## API REST

>⚠️ Inventory & Shipping module API REST calls must be made using AppKey and AppToken. For more info, read our article on [how to generate an Appkey and um AppToken ti authenticate your integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-generate-an-appkey-and-apptoken-to-integrations--43tQeyQJgAKGEuCqQKAOI2)

To add a **loading dock** using API, your need to send a __POST__ to the following endpoint:

`https://logistics.{{environment}}.com.br/api/logistics/pvt/configuration/docks?an={{accountName}}`

- The request's object has the following properties:

| __Properties__ | __Types__ |__Description__|
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| id| object| loading dock ID|
| name| string| loading dock name|
| priority| integer| Interval from 0 to 10 used to define route priority|
| dockTimeFake| integer| processing time|
| timeFakeOverhead| integer| Overhead time|
| salesChannels| nullable| sales channels|
