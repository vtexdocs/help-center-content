Our recommendation is for physical stores to always be configured as franchise accounts on the VTEX platform. You can install and access the VTEX Sales App application from the brand’s main account. The application retrieves information about the stock and delivery options from the franchise accounts, i.e. from the physical stores and the main account.

To create a franchise account, please contact our [Support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) team.

Before you start using VTEX Sales App, make sure your store already has franchise accounts associated with your main account.

When you create a franchise account, each one of your physical stores will have a separate VTEX Admin with its own logistics, but will inherit the catalog of the main account.

Your franchise accounts will function as [White Label Sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-are-franchise-account-and-seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa#what-is-a-seller-white-label). This means that whenever an order is placed through any channel, be it VTEX Sales App or ecommerce, the system will search for the store with the best [SLA](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-the-platform-s-operation-sla-is--2cIFrsY5S8usk84OU4QOKm) delivery.

>⚠️ Each seller must have a different company registration number for order payments to work correctly.

You can manage the logistics for each franchise account using a separate VTEX Admin. To access it, use the URL `{name-of-franchise-account}.myvtex.com/admin URL`.

For more details about this type of account and its settings, please refer to [What is a franchise account?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl).
