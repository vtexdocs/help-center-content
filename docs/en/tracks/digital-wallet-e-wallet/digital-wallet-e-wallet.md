A digital wallet (also known as an ewallet) is a secure environment where bank and credit card information can be stored. This information is encrypted in the system and, when accessed by its owner, can be used to make online purchases.

Shopping with a digital wallet offers more security for the users, since they do not need to enter their payment information at the store checkout. Instead, the user is redirected to the digital wallet environment, where they must go through authentication steps.

Once their identity is verified and they have selected a payment method, the order goes back to its normal flow and is completed. Some digital wallets also act as subacquirers, allowing unregistered users to make purchases in their environment.
