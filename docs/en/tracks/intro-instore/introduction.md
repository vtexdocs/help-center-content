In this Track, we will show you a step by step on how to set up VTEX inStore for your business.

## What is VTEX inStore

VTEX inStore is a solution that revolutionizes the shopping experience in brick-and-mortar stores. With a simple and quick setup, your sales associates will be able to offer your customers a customized service, while carrying out the entire sales process, from assistance in choosing products to payment and delivery.

## Why use VTEX inStore?

VTEX inStore brings the power of e-commerce to your physical store. With it, your store will be able to use the information provided by e-commerce to leverage your sales.

This sharing of information is the great strength of the *__omnichannel__* experience. With inStore, you can have access to data on your customers' e-commerce preferences and purchasing history. It will also be a powerful tool in case of stock-outs, acting as a shelf extension for your brick and mortar (B&M) store.

We are using our greatest asset, technology, to offer the consumer a smooth purchase experience and the retailer an efficient sale, just as we already do in the virtual world.
