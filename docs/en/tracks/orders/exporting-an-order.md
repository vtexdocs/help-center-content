You can export orders through the **All Orders** module in VTEX Admin.

In this process, the system generates a report in .csv format containing details about your store's orders. Find out what information is in the report in [our tutorial on the order spreadsheet fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/orders-worksheet--31m1ewsmsEe0WS4So2aGMY).

>ℹ️ If the number of orders selected to be exported is very high, it might cause slow performance. Therefore, you can only select a limited number of orders. Currently, exports are limited to **50,000 orders at a time**.

Follow the instructions below to create the report:

1. In your VTEX Admin, access **Orders > All Orders**, or type **All Orders** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. [Filter orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/filtering-orders-in-oms--tutorials_192) considering the 50,000 limit.
3. Click the button `Export`, and a link with a file in .csv format will be sent to your [user](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-usuarios--tutorials_512) email.
4. Open your email and download the link within 72 hours; the link will expire after that period.
