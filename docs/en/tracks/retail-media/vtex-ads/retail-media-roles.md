In a retail media operation, there are three main roles: **advertisers**, **publishers and marketing agencies**. See what each of these roles means and how they operate in the context of VTEX Ads:

| Role | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Advertisers** | Brands or manufacturers that want to promote their products in the sales channels owned by merchants. In VTEX Ads, advertisers set up and manage campaigns using sponsored custom displays, banners, and other placements on the publisher’s website. |
| **Publishers** | Publishers offering advertising spaces for monetization. In VTEX Ads, the publisher controls the available spaces, approves campaigns, and tracks the results of the ads displayed in their store. |
| **Marketing agencies** | Companies or outsourced teams acting on behalf of the advertiser or publisher. In VTEX Ads, agencies can plan, configure, monitor, and optimize campaigns, ensuring the best media use and alignment with client goals. Agencies are especially common when the advertiser or publisher doesn’t have an in-house team dedicated to media operations. |
