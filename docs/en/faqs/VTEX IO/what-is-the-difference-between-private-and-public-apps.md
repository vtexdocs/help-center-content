Applications developed in VTEX IO can be public or private.

A __private app__ is installed only in your Registry. That is, it can only be seen by users with access to the account of the store in which the app was created.

A __public app__ is available to any user. It appears in the Extension Store under the new VTEX Admin: `https://{AccountName}.myvtex.com/admin/extensions/explore`

Examples of public apps are Visa Checkout and Masterpass.
