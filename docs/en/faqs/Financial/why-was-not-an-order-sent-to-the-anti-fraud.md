Whenever a payment is made, the payment gateway connector performs some initial validations to proceed with the payment. At this point, the connector waits for responses regarding its validations.

After several attempts, if you don't get the expected responses, the payment and the order are both canceled. Orders in this situation are not sent to the anti-fraud.

>⚠️ You can not resubmit a canceled order to the anti-fraud.
