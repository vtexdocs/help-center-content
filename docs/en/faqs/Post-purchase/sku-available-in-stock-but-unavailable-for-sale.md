<!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! -->

When two or more warehouses use the same [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-trade-policies-work--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV), and there is a negative number of items in stock for a given SKU in one of these warehouses, the SKU becomes unavailable for sale, even though the [inventory](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-stock-items--tutorials_139) quantity is positive in another warehouse.

This occurs because the VTEX platform sums the negative number of items for that SKU in a warehouse to the positive number of items in other warehouses. If the result of the sum equals zero, the SKU will be unavailable for sale.

Learn more about negative inventory in the article [Inventory management](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-stock-items--tutorials_139#updating-inventory).
