Understand why your product ads are not displayed on the page when an integration with the Mercado Livre marketplace exists.

One of the ways in which a client showcases his/her products on the desired marketplace is to catalogue the products he/she wishes to sell.

Once this step is corrently performed, the item in question is displayed on Mercado Livre through the use of an ad.

Eventually, this may lead to the sale of an item that is not in stock at the moment of purchase.

Paused ads on Mercado Livre occur for mainly __two reasons__:

## The product has either been removed or deactivated from the sales policy linked to Mercado Livre ##


Defining a [política comercial](https://help.vtex.com/pt/faq/o-que-e-uma-politica-comercial "política comercial") is the first step towards an [integração com o Mercado Livre](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/configurar-integracao-do-mercado-livre?step=1#definindo-catalogo-de-produtos "integração com o Mercado Livre"). In other words, establishing a catalogue and/or logistics differentiation between a store's various sales channels.

When a product is removed from the sales policy, this update is automatically sent to Mercado Livre, which, in turn, stops displaying the ad for the product.


## The product has reached the minimum registered inventory ##

Upon registering a product, a minimum inventory quantity for that item needs to be established. When the number of products in stock reaches that established limit, the ad is removed from Mercado Livre.

It is worth mentioning that the minimum value for that inventory is set in Mercado Livre's settings panel, in VTEX Bridge.
