To find a Price Table: 

1. Click on **Price Table**
2. Type the name of the table that you wish to find in **Search**

To include a price in the Price Table, you will need to add a base price to your SKUs. Access our article on [how to add a base price](/en/tutorial/cadastrar-o-preco-base-de-um-produto--4S9SbPWlVmOAAWO6yq8wE6).

> ℹ️ You can not create price tables with equal names. You can not add special characters to price table names. Just letters and numbers. 
> ⚠️ For security reasons, you can not manually delete price tables. If you need to delete a price table, open a ticket with VTEX support.
