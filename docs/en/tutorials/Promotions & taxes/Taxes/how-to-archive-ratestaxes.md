If you want to remove a rate created from the main list, for example, because it is not being used, you can move it to the list of archived taxes. By doing this, the status of the rate will be automatically changed to inactive. To do so, follow the steps below:

![example 1](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/14f4EpASB8c2m2kMEcES0c/7e83ef6235c1d6bb8071fb4a2ae0dea4/example_1.png)

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to *Promotions > Taxes*, or type *Taxes* in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Search the rate that you intend to archive.
3. Click on the **Archive** button on the rate card, or click directly on the rate card and then on the **Archive** button, on the bottom right corner.
4. Then confirm your intention to archive the rate.

In order to view all archived and non-archived promotions, click on the selection box on the right upper corner of the main promotions page.
