Below you will find a description of the page components and the actions you can perform.

## Top bar

The top bar of the **Coupons** page contains a search field as well as filters and buttons for exporting coupons, consulting coupon usage details and accessing the archived coupon list.  Learn more about each of these possibilities in the sections below.

### Searching for coupons

To find a specific coupon, use the search field. You can search by coupon code, by [UTM source](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-are-utm-source-utm-campaign-and-utm-medium--2wTz7QJ8KUG6skGAoAQuii) or by [UTM campaign](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-are-utm-source-utm-campaign-and-utm-medium--2wTz7QJ8KUG6skGAoAQuii).

### Filtering coupons

Use the filters to view only coupons corresponding to certain criteria. To apply filters, follow the steps below.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to *Promotions > Coupons*, or type *Coupons* in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Select the filter you want to use:
   * **Last modified:** Indicates the last time a coupon was modified.
   * **Coupon type:** Indicates if it is a single coupon or a coupon batch. For a better understanding of different coupon types, please read [Coupons](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/coupons-beta--1aAEN3ADpz19ss5JCIEBdL).
3. Check the desired option.
4. Click `Apply`.
5. Repeat the process if you want to apply a different filter.

To clear the filters, i.e., to remove the applied filters, you have two options:

* Click <i class="fas fa-times"></i> next to the filter you want to remove.
* Click `Clear all filters` to remove all applied filters.

### Exporting coupons

You can download all your coupons and their details in a CSV file.

To export the coupons, click the button <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-to-line"></i> `Export` next to the search field. The exported list will reflect the applied [filters](#filtering-coupons).

The generated file contains the information described below.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `code` | Coupon code. For a coupon batch, the generated code prefix is indicated. |
| `type` | Indicates whether it is a `single` coupon or a coupon `batch`. For more information on each coupon type, please refer to [Coupons](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/coupons-beta--1aAEN3ADpz19ss5JCIEBdL). To learn how to export the codes generated in a coupon batch, please read [Exporting coupon batch codes](#exporting-coupon-batch-codes). |
| `quantity` | The number of coupon codes. For single coupons, the value is always `1`. For coupon batches, the number of codes for a specific coupon batch is indicated. |
| `archived` | Indicates if the coupon is archived (`true`) or active (`false`). |
| `utmSource` | Indicates the UTM source linked to the coupon, if any. |
| `utmCampaign` | Indicates the UTM campaign linked to the coupon, if any. |
| `maxUsage` | The maximum number of times the coupon can be used. |
| `maxItemsPerClient` | Determines the maximum number of products to which the coupon can be applied. The defined quantity is valid for one or more purchases made by the same customer. This option mentions a value only for already existing coupons, configured with this limitation in previous versions of the __Coupons__ module. |
| `expirationIntervalPerUse` | The minimum period of time before a coupon can be reused. |
| `lastModified` | The date the coupon was last modified. |

Here is an example of an exported CSV file:

#### Exporting coupon batch codes

The exported CSV file displays one row for a coupon batch, which means it doesn't show all the codes within the coupon batch, only its prefix.

To view or export all the codes within a coupon batch, you must follow the steps below: 

1. Find the coupon batch in the [coupon list](#coupon-list).
2. Click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> on the coupon batch row for more options.
3. Click <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-to-line"></i> **Export**.

    Two options will appear on the screen:

    * <i class="far fa-clone"></i> **Copy all:** Allows you to copy the generated codes to your clipboard. You can also copy each code individually by clicking it.
    * **Export:** Allows exporting the generated coupons to a CSV file. The exported file contains a single column, with one code per row.
