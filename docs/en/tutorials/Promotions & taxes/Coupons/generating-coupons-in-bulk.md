Coupon creation for promotions must be doneÂ in the **Promotions & Taxes** module and is documented in our article [How to create a coupon](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-a-coupon--tutorials_319). However, there may be situations when you need to create many coupons at once due to a campaign or marketing initiative.

You cannot generate coupons in bulk in the VTEX Admin, only using the Promotions & Taxes API. For more information, read our guide [Creating and managing coupons with Promotions API](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/creating-and-managing-coupons-with-promotions-api).
