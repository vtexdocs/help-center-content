The Promotions & Taxes module is the place where the configuration of promotions and fees applied to your online store is carried out. Here, you can also create coupons to be associated to promotions. According to the configuration, a promotion can be scheduled, enabled or disabled and, after its creation, it can also be found through search or filter tools, and filed.

There are four departments within this module responsible for configuring each of these features. And they are:

## Campaign Audiences

A campaign audience is a way of defining the target audience to which a benefit can be applied. In other words, you can create customer segments based on the definition of some criteria that will be eligible for a given campaign audience and consequently one or more benefits. A campaign audience can be associated with one or more campaign benefits.

Here, the discounts that your store will offer are created. You can also view, filter, search and file all promotions. According to each store configuration, there is a limit of promotions that can be enabled at the same time.
