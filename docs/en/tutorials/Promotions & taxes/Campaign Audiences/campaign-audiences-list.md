On this page, you can perform the following actions:

* [View campaign audiences](#view-campaign-audiences)
* [Search for a campaign audience](#search-for-a-campaign-audience)
* [Archive a campaign audience](#archive-a-campaign-audience)
* [Edit a campaign audience](#edit-a-campaign-audience)

### Creating a campaign audience

To create a Campaign audience, in *Promotions > Campaign audience*, you must click the `New Campaign Audience` button and follow the steps described in the article [Creating a Campaign Audience](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-campaign-audiences--6cnuDZJzIkIeocewAQQK4K).

>⚠️ To activate the newly created campaign audience, you must associate it to a [Campaign promotion](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/campaign-promotion--1ChYXhK2AQGuS6wAqS8Ume).

### Viewing campaign audiences

The campaign audiences displayed in *Promotions > Campaign audience* are by default the **Active** ones (not archived), i.e. the ones available to use.

The campaign audiences are displayed in _cards_ containing the following information:

* **Name:** Name of the campaign audience.
* **Description:** Internal description of the campaign audience.
* **Status:** Current availability status of the campaign audience.
    * **Active:** The campaign audience is available to use in your store's promotion campaigns, i.e. it is not archived.
    * **Inactive:** The campaign audience is not available to use in your store's promotion campaigns. This status is not permanent — you can reactivate a campaign audience at any time.
* **Target audience:** Name of the [target audience](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/campaign-audiences--3o7lhpNseXY2WmjZO0gQ6m#target-audience) associated to the campaign audience.

To view the [archived](#archiving-a-campaign-audience) campaign audiences, next to the **Show** option, click **Archived**, as illustrated below:
