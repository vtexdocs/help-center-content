After [configuring a campaign audience](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-campaigns--6cnuDZJzIkIeocewAQQK4K), you can create a target audience for it. 

The target audience segments the customers and conditions that are eligible for the campaign audience. If it is an ongoing and active campaign audience, the promotions associated with it will be activated when meeting the defined target audience criteria.

When all campaign audience restrictions are met and the campaign audience is activated and eligible, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the promotions associated with it are applicable. For this, the restrictions defined in the [campaign audience promotion](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-a-campaign-benefit--1ChYXhK2AQGuS6wAqS8Ume) must also be met.

## Define your target audience

- Name: target audience name.

## Items to use for this target audience

__Categories, Brands, Collections, and SKUs__: must meet all added conditions. Select the Categories, Brands, Collections, and SKUs that you want to include in the campaign audience.

Example: if a category and a brand are added, the campaign audience will only be activated if the product meets both conditions. 

__At least 'X' products meet the criteria above__: you can only configure it if all connectors are configured with the value "Equal to". 

### Conditions for the target audience to be applicable
