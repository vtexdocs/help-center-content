## 4. Restrictions and limitations of use

In this section, you will find important information about the promotion conditions and restrictions.

- **How many times will this promotion be applied in your store**: Limits the number of times the promotion will be applied. If you uncheck the **unlimited** field, the times field becomes available to enter the maximum number of times the promotion can be used. This only applies for orders created after the condition has been set up. It will not affect orders placed previously.
- **How many times per customer will this promotion be applied in your store**:This field's value determines the maximum number of times each customer can benefit from the promotion. For example, if you set a limit of three uses and the promotion is applied three times on a single order, this will be considered a single use in relation to the total limit. This way, the customer can still use the promotion on two different orders. Note that this calculation is done regardless of how many times the promotion has been used on each individual order.
- **Set maximum number of eligible items for each cart**: Defines the maximum number of items in the cart that will be affected by the promotion. Check out [this article](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/promocoes--6asfF1vFYiZgTQtOzwJchR/jOu9b69mKbrTDfSJYAawy) to learn how to configure this field.
- **Apply with other promotions**: if selected, more than one promotion can be applied simultaneously, regardless of the discount type. Learn more in the [How promotion competition works](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/entendendo-a-concorrencia-de-promocoes--tutorials_2270) article.
- **Apply with manual prices**: allows the promotion to apply to products whose prices were manually added via telesales. To enable the manual pricing feature, use the [Update orderForm configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/checkout-api#post-/api/checkout/pvt/configuration/orderForm) endpoint.
