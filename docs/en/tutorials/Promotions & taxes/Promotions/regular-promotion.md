VTEX allows you to [create many types of promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-promotions--tutorials_320#como-criar-promocoes) for different scenarios, but the most used one is the Regular Promotion. It allows your store to offer discounts in a dynamic and flexible way, combining multiple conditions, restrictions and benefits.

In this article, we describe each field in the regular promotion configuration steps listed below.

1. [Promotion overview](#1-promotion-overview)
    - [Restrict this promotion to products from sellers](#restrict-this-promotion-to-products-from-sellers)
    - [Trade Policy](#trade-policy)
2. [To which items will this promotion apply?](#2-to-which-items-will-this-promotion-apply)
3. [What are the conditions for the promotion to be valid?](#3-what-are-the-conditions-for-the-promotion-to-be-valid)
4. [Restrictions and limitations of use](#4-restrictions-and-limitations-of-use)

To understand the implementation of promotions, read the article on [Promotion Examples](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/promotion-examples--5A8UTc7knvAscxo7e7rMFD?&utm_source=autocomplete#).

## 1. Promotion overview

In this section, you must configure the general information of your promotion. The fields **Name**, **Expiration date** and **What is the type and amount of discount** are mandatory.

- **Name**: Promotion name.
- **Status:** Activate or deactivate the promotion.
- **Description**: Promotion's internal description. This field is used in your store's internal communication to show the promotion's origin (campaign, stock clearance, etc).
- **Expiration Date:** Promotion's start and end date and time. A future date and/or time can be used to launch the promotion on the website. If configured this way, the promotion will have a scheduled status until the set date and time are reached. As long as the promotion is valid, it will be active and, at the end of the set date and time, the status will change to inactive automatically.
- **Use recurrence settings**: This option is a checkbox type options that when checked makes seven other checkboxes available to select the days of the week and the hours of the day during which the promotion will apply. If you want the promotion to apply on every day of the week, do not select this option.
- **What is the type and amount of discount?**: A selection that defines the kind and amount of discount that will apply to the promotion. See the discount options below:

  - **Nominal**: Exact discount to be applied for the total purchase value.
  - **Nominal shipping**: Exact discount to be applied for the shipping value.
  - **Percentage**: Percentage discount to be applied for total purchase value.
  - **Maximum Price per Item**: The maximum price for each item of the purchase will be the price set up.
  - **Percentage shipping**: Percentage discount to be applied for shipping value. 
  - **Maximum shipping**: Shipping maximum value. 
  - **Free Shipping**: 100% discount on shipping value.
  - **Gift**: total discount applied to the value of the product defined as a gift. The maximum quantity refers to the number of different SKUs the user can select. For example, if there is only 1 SKU available, the user will only be able to select one unit of that SKU, even if the maximum quantity is greater than 1. If there are 8 SKUs available and the maximum quantity is 3, the user can choose up to 3 different SKUs. Even if the allowed maximum quantity is higher than the number of available SKUs, the user can only select one unit of each SKU. The flag [Activate gift multiplier](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-significa-ativar-o-multiplicador-de-brinde-em-uma-promocao--1gydgkmjEWcoo2CskUwuYK) only works in Buy and Get promotions. In regular promotions, the flag is available for selection but has no effect in the cart.

>ℹ️ The gift also needs to have a nominal price, even if it's given for free to the customer.
  - **Nominal discount based on formula**: the discount is calculated based on the a formula that you can create using the products' total price (`total`), shipping fees (`freight`), and quantity of items (`quantity`) as variables. Note that the shipping value in the formula will be the lowest available for the order, regardless of the customer's selection. The decimal separator symbol must always be the decimal point. For example: if the discount is 30% of the total product value + shipping value, the formula should be `(total + freight) * 0.3`. For more information on the formula, read our [documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion-with-nominal-discount-based-on-formula--2Pwrq6THyGViNedQG381jV).
  - **Nominal reward value**: Nominal value for rewards program. Read [Regular promotion with reward value](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion-with-reward-value--3FCip23ZtvG0sDt0rVGVmR) for more information.
  - **Percentage reward value**: Percentage value for rewards program. Read [Regular promotion with reward value](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion-with-reward-value--3FCip23ZtvG0sDt0rVGVmR) for more information.
  - **Promotional price table**: Price table used for promotions. The promotional price of each SKU will be its corresponding value in the selected price table.

- **Promotion is highlighted:** If you select **Yes**, you can insert a flag with the promotion name used in the product's window display and page. This tag will only be added if you use the correct promotion display control in the template: `<vtex.cmc:discountHightLight/>`.

>ℹ️ **Nominal** promotions will only be displayed in the cart, not on the shelf or product page.

### Restrict this promotion to products from sellers

In this section, you can set which sellers the promotion will apply to as well as determine which ones will be included or excluded from the discount applied. 

- **Equal to:** Select the desired sellers' names to include them.
- **Different from:** Select the desired sellers' names to exclude them.

To enable a promotion for all sellers, leave the checkbox empty.

>⚠️ You cannot directly select a white label seller. To include a white label seller to the promotion, there are two options:1. Restrict sellers to the main store. This restriction adds all your store's white label sellers to the promotion.2. Leave the checkbox empty to include all sellers, meaning that all types of sellers - whether white label or not - will be added to the promotion.

- **Equal to:** Select the desired sales policies to include.
