The VTEX platform allows you to optimally and practically add different promotion types suited for different scenarios. Through a centralized interface for managing promotions, your store can offer more benefits focused on customer attraction and retention.

The **Promotions** module is flexible when it comes to creating promotion scenarios with specific conditions for different contexts. Besides filtering and exporting promotions, you can view the active ones and archive them.

Access the page in the VTEX Admin through the <i class="fas fa-bullhorn"></i> **Promotions > Promotions**.

The page displays the list of your store's promotions and their basic information:

| **Field name** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `Name` | Promotion name. |
| `From` | Promotion start date. |
| `To` | Promotion end date. |
| `Status` | Promotion status, which can be: <p> __Active:__ when a promotion is active.</p> <p>__Scheduled:__ when the promotion was scheduled.</p> <p>__Paused:__ when the promotion is paused. <p>__Completed:__ when the promotion ended.</p> |
