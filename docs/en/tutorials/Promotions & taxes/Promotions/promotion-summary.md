The promotion summary displays the information configured for a promotion before it is activated. This allows you to make sure that all data in the promotion is correct, avoiding implementation errors.

The promotion summary features:

- [General data](#general-data)
- [Items](#items)
- [Conditions](#conditions)
- [Restrictions](#restrictions)
- [Sellers](#sellers)
- [Trade policy](#trade-policy)
- [Types of alerts](#types-of-alerts)

After reviewing the promotion, click `Save` to activate it. If you wish to edit any field, click `Cancel` and change the information you want.

## General data
In this section, you can review the information configured in the section [Promotion overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#1-promotion-overview) of the promotion form.

## Items
Here, you can see the items selected in the section [To which items will this promotion apply?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#2-to-which-items-will-this-promotion-apply) when configuring the promotion.

- **Included items:** categories, brands, collections, products, or SKUs to which the promotion will be applied.
- **Excluded items:** categories, brands, collections, products, or SKUs that will be excluded from the promotion, which means the promotion will be valid for the rest of the catalog.

The customer's order must meet the conditions in this section to be valid for the promotion.

## Types of alerts
The promotion summary can display three different types of alerts. See the descriptions below for more information.

### High risk
High-risk alerts indicate that critical configurations or registration errors must be reviewed, as they may negatively affect the performance of the promotion, and, consequently, the store's operating margin.

Example:

![alert-alto-risco-EN](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5RRucT5TJJKfoe39NsQvPx/6024c1bf2aee399450f05cbf2648798c/image.png)

### Medium risk
Medium-risk alerts indicate that there are configurations that may cause undesired effects on the promotion.

Example:

![alert-medio-risco-EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1vYDqk4ZK3X2jjfGBY0voq/38a07c0774736c5005638e78987d4a23/image.png)

### Low risk
Low-risk alerts present relevant information about the promotion configuration, which can contribute to better performance.

Example:

![alert-baixo-risco-EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/tvjluVBbsK78ozr29Fgfb/65f04416a92b8c5bd606064165803313/image.png)
