The promotion summary displays the information configured for a promotion before it is activated. This allows you to make sure that all data in the promotion is correct, avoiding implementation errors.

The promotion summary features:

- [General data](#general-data)
- [Items](#items)
- [Conditions](#conditions)
- [Restrictions](#restrictions)
- [Sellers](#sellers)
- [Trade policy](#trade-policy)
- [Types of alerts](#types-of-alerts)

After reviewing the promotion, click `Save` to activate it. If you wish to edit any field, click `Cancel` and change the information you want.

## General data
In this section, you can review the information configured in the section [Promotion overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#1-promotion-overview) of the promotion form.

- **Name:** the name of the promotion.
- **Duration:** the period in which the promotion is valid.
- **Recurrence:** the days of the week and the time of day in which the promotion will be applied.
- **Discount type:** the type of discount selected when configuring the promotion.
- **Highlight:** a banner with the name of the promotion, displayed on the storefront and the product page.

## Items
Here, you can see the items selected in the section [To which items will this promotion apply?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#2-to-which-items-will-this-promotion-apply) when configuring the promotion.

- **Included items:** categories, brands, collections, products, or SKUs to which the promotion will be applied.
- **Excluded items:** categories, brands, collections, products, or SKUs that will be excluded from the promotion, which means the promotion will be valid for the rest of the catalog.

## Conditions
In this section, the conditions configured in [What are the conditions for the promotion to be valid?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#3-what-are-the-conditions-for-the-promotion-to-be-valid) are displayed. The customer's order must meet the conditions in this section to be valid for the promotion.

## Restrictions
This section displays the [Restrictions and limitations of use](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#4-restrictions-and-limitations-of-use) configured for the promotion.

## Sellers
This section displays the sellers that will be included or excluded from the promotion, as configured in the section [Restrict this promotion to products from sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#restrict-this-promotion-to-products-from-sellers) of the promotion.

## Trade policy
This section displays the trade policies valid for the promotion, configured in the [Trade Policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/regular-promotion--tutorials_327#trade-policy) part of the promotion form.

## Types of alerts
The promotion summary can display three different types of alerts. See the descriptions below for more information.

### High risk
High-risk alerts indicate that critical configurations or registration errors must be reviewed, as they may negatively affect the performance of the promotion, and, consequently, the store's operating margin.

Example:

![alert-alto-risco-EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Promotions%20&%20taxes/Promotions/promotion-summary_1.png)

### Medium risk
Medium-risk alerts indicate that there are configurations that may cause undesired effects on the promotion.

Example:

![alert-medio-risco-EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Promotions%20&%20taxes/Promotions/promotion-summary_2.png)

### Low risk
Low-risk alerts present relevant information about the promotion configuration, which can contribute to better performance.

Example:

![alert-baixo-risco-EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Promotions%20&%20taxes/Promotions/promotion-summary_3.png)
