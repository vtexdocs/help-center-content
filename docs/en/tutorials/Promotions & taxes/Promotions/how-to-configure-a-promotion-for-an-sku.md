A promotion is always configured as a discount related to a product, encompassing all its SKUs. However, there is a way to configure **Buy One Get One** and **Discount Percentage** promotions for a specific SKU of the product.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to *Promotions > Promotions*, or type *Promotions* in the search bar at the top of the page.
