Before activating your promotional price table, you must have a already created a price table. See our tutorial for more info on **[creating price tables](/en/tutorial/criar-tabelas-de-precos?locale=en).** Complete this step first and then move onto the next steps.

After choosing a price table that you wish to use, you can create a promotional price table, using the two types of discount highlighted below. Check which fields to fill out here:  **[regular benefits](/en/tutorial/promocao-regular?locale=en) or [campaign audience benefits](/en/tutorial/promocao-de-campanha?locale=en)**

The steps above must be successfully completed prior to attempting to create a promotional price table. Afterwards, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to *Promotions > Promotions*, or type *Promotions* in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Access __Create Promotion__.
3. Choose either the __Regular__ option or the __Campaign Promotion__.
4. Fill out the required fields.
5. **Notice:** Make sure you select the Promotional Price Table option in the "What kind and amount of **Benefit**?

After completing the above you just need to enable your benefit or campaign audience and your price table will be active and applied to your store's SKUs price.

Some important consideration regarding the promotional price table:

- The price table configured price will only be applied if the value is less than the value set by site in the trade policy.
- Promotional price table compete among themselves as well as with other configured benefits that are not set to be cumulative
- You can only configure one price table for each benefit
- A limit of ten (10) simultaneous price table benefits for each store is presently enforced
- Teaser only works with regular benefits
- After configuring the price table and benefit, it can take up to ten (10) minutes for the discount to become linked to your store's product.
