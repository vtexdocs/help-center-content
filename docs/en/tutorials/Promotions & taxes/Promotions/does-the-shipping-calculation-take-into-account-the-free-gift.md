The system charges shipping bearing in mind the free gift in the shopping cart.

To calculate the shipping, it is necessary to also take into account the volume and weight of the free gift.

## Free Shipping Promotion for free gifts

When offering promotions that include gifts, it's crucial to correctly configure the size and volume of these items. If the gift has defined dimensions or weight, this information will affect the shipping cost calculation.

This means that when a gift is added to the cart, the shipping cost may be adjusted to include the cost of shipping that item. However, if the goal is to offer free shipping, even with the gift, it's important to follow these steps:

- Create a combined promotion that guarantees free shipping for the gift. This ensures that shipping remains free even when the gift is added to the cart.
- Set the gift's dimensions (size and volume) to zero. This way, the system will disregard the gift in the shipping cost calculation, preventing additional charges.

## Dealing with selecting the free gift at the front

The front can "uncheck" the selection of the free gift. In this case, the free gift will be displayed below the list of the main items. When selecting the free gift, the customer will see a message from the shopping cart indicating that the shipping cost has increased. So, they can decide whether or not to keep the free gift in the shopping cart.
