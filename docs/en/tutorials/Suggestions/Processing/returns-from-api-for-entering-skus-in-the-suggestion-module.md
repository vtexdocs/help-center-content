Some stores use partners to integrate sellers’ SKUs, in VTEX-VTEX integrations, using APIs. The purpose of this article is to help you deal with the errors that may be returned during this operation.

The APIs used to integrate sellers’ SKUs can be found at: [https://developers.vtex.com/reference/marketplace-api-overview](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/marketplace-api-overview)

When SKUs are entered via API, some errors may be returned in addition to the confirmed success returns. These errors are listed in the following table: each of them is identified by a number from 0 to 23 (apart from errors 99 and 999, which are unknown errors). The column on the left shows the names describing each error.

From this table you can see what the errors returned in the integration refer to, so that the SKU suggestions can be handled and approved successfully.
