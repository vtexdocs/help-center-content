VTEX Matcher is a tool used by marketplaces to analyze offers submitted by sellers and accelerate their cataloging process.

VTEX Matcher analyzes SKUs by matching information from a seller's offer to items already listed in the marketplace catalog. Here are the attributes analyzed in an offer:

- SKU name  
- Product name  
- Brand  
- Category  
- EAN or Ref ID  
- Height  
- Width  
- Length  
- Weight  
- Image name  
- Image URL  
- Specifications  

## Score 
Received offers are queued to be analyzed by VTEX Matcher. Received SKUs that belong to the same product follow a prioritization rule: SKUs are analyzed in order of arrival.

VTEX Matcher assigns a score to each attribute that matches existing product information in the marketplace. Then all points are added together, generating a final score for the offer.

The final score determines the product status as follows: Approved, Denied, or Pending. 

## Cataloging
Check the table below to see the statuses generated by different scores and their corresponding actions.

<div class="alert alert-info">
The maximum VTEX Matcher score for automatic cataloging is 95. Scores greater than 95 require manual cataloging.

## Configuring Matcher

The criteria described in this article are standard. You can configure VTEX Matcher differently through the [automatic approval API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis-suggestions#put-/suggestions/configuration/autoapproval/toggle).

The VTEX platform also allows you to use other matchers developed by internal teams or partners.

By doing so, matchers will work in parallel. This means that they do not replace each other but work in a complementary way. Whenever a product or SKU is sent to the marketplace, all matchers will be notified to start the evaluation process. Similarly, for a SKU to be stated as denied, it must be rejected by all active matchers in the store.
