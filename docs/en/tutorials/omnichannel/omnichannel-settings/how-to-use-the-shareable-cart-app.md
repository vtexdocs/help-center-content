The [Shareable Cart](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-social-selling/p) app allows sales assistants to select products for their customers and share the cart through channels such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and email (Social Selling).

![Shareable Cart Demo](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/omnichannel/omnichannel-settings/how-to-use-the-shareable-cart-app_1.gif)

This article details the steps needed to use this feature: activate the app, choose products, add sales assistant code, share and create a new cart. Before you start, you need to [activate this feature in your store](/en/tutorial/como-ativar-o-app-carrinho-compartilhavel--1lS3fQdXpOoC0BTeVhydfg).

## Activating the app

You must activate the app in your first access, by accessing the store from the link:

`https://{Your store web address}/checkout/?socialselling=on`

`{Your store web address}` should be replaced with the address of the store's website. This activation must be done whenever you change devices or clear browsing data.

The cart sharing interface should appear on the screen, including some of the icons below. The options available depend on the configuration chosen by the store.

## Choosing products

Once the app is activated, it is not necessary to log in to start browsing and to select products. Just browse the store as usual, as if you were making an online purchase. After choosing all products for the customer, open the cart and follow the next steps in the cart sharing interface.
