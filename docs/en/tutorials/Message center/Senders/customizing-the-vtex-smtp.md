VTEX has an email server that you can use free of charge. 
Also, it is possible to arrange for emails to be sent with the storeâ€™s address rather than the standard VTEX email address. To configure this, proceed as follows.

1. On the Admin menu, click on **Message Center**.
2. Click on **Senders**.
3. Click on the **New Provider** button and select **Own**.
4. Create a name to go in the **Sender ID** field, which will be used to identify the sender on the Providers screen and to associate the SMTP to be used with the templates you require.
5. In the **Name** field, enter the name to be used which is associated with the email address.
6. In the **Email** field, enter the email address that your store will be using for communications with customers.
7. Do __not__ select the **This is the default sender**Â flag until after you have completed registration and have checked that the sender created is in fact shown as such on emails.
8. Click on **Save**.
9. You will receive an email confirming that the SMTP has been successfully registered.
10. Edit the sender to mark it as **default** and save the changes.

Every time you make a change in the sender and save, an SMTP confirmation email will be sent successfully to the registered address. __You must click the link__. Otherwise, no email will be sent regarding the registered email. You can also test whether the sending is OK by clicking the __Test__ button for the respective sender in __Message Center__> __Senders__.
