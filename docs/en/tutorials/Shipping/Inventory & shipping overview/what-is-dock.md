A dock is a step in the logistics process between the inventory and the carriers. It works as an area in the distribution center for loading and/or unloading SKUs. That is, it receives or holds SKUs from one or more inventories, and then hand those itens to the carriers responsible for delivering them to the final recipient.

In dock registration, you can set a name for the dock, the sales policies wich are related to it, the carriers it is associated with, the time that should be added to the delivery time, and priorities. 

You may also create different routes for their logistics, with different terms and prices.
