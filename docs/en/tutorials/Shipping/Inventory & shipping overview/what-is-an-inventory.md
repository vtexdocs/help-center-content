Inventory is the physical space used to store the goods of an e-commerce, functioning as the availability repository of your store's items. It's also the place of logistics for the continuous insertion of new amounts of items in stock and reservation changes during the outflow of orders. Through the inventory you may control the movement of new incoming and purchased items.

In VTEX platform, it's possible to register the name of one or more stocks, the docks that will consume these stocks, the time the SKU will take to be transported to the dock and the value charged for this transport.
