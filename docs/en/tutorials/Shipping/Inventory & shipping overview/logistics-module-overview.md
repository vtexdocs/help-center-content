The **Inventory & shipping** module is the place for controlling and monitoring the availability of the items in inventory, as well as designing the delivery structure of orders, in a way that meets the different needs of each store delivery system.

It also contains the following sections: **Shipping Strategy**, **Shipping rates**, **Shipping Simulator**, **Inventory**, **Geolocation shipping**, **Pickup points**, **Holidays** and **Settings**, each one performing a function within that segment.

## Shipping strategy

That's where you can register the relation between **[Warehouse](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estoque--6oIxvsVDTtGpO7y6zwhGpb)**, **[Loading dock](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/doca--5DY8xHEjOLYDVL41Urd5qj)** and **[Shipping policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/registering-a-carrier)**, that will communicate with each other to set the delivery structure of the orders, building the best delivery infrastructure for your store.

## Shipping rates

That's where you can register the set prices and delivery time for a particular ZIP code range, considering cubic weight, dimensions, among other factors.

## Shipping Simulator

Here you can play with different scenarios for the delivery of your product, choosing which channel will be used as reference (if the main store or a marketplace, for example); items; quantity; value (if there is any additional cost due to the product nature, like chemicals, for example); and ZIP code (or address) of the delivery.

this section then shows the values and the carriers related to the delivery, dimension and weight of the products, price of the delivery and estimated time, besides additional details on the Zip Code range values, percentages that vary according to the product weight range, volume, additional value per gram, cost to the dock, cubic factor and cubic weight.

## Inventory

A place to manage and track the stock movement held in store products. It registers the reservations made on a product so far and if they have been confirmed or not.

## Geolocation shipping

Here you can build polygons for a specific logistic service. That’s typically used in rural and industrial areas, for example, where the division is made by lots, or in hazardous areas, where it's necessary to avoid determined sites. The feature’s structure is dynamic, so that you can easily draw on the map the area to be delimited.

- [Geolocation](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/registering-geolocation)

## Pickup points

Here you can delete, edit and register a Pickup Point. As a new delivery channel option, the Pickup Point feature provides greater flexibility and purchase experience to the customer as it allows the order pickup to be made in a physical point.

## Holidays

Here it is possible to register the days that **will not** be considered as useful for your store. The module will consider the holidays registered on this section and these days will not be counted in the delivery deadline.

## General settings

Here it is possible to apply general settings to perform the construction of both values and delivery structure, meeting even the most specific type of delivery demand from a customer.
