Shipping rates are the shipping options your store offers to customers, and they are related to your store's [shipping policies](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140). Prices agreed between your store and the responsible for the delivery service, such as carriers, pickup points, and service providers, must be configured as **shipping rates.**

>⚠️ The [total shipping cost](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/total-shipping-cost--5bwhIO108VA5Y2YOpef9lV) to the customer includes the shipping rate, [additional shipping costs](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/additional-shipping-costs--2vqGwMn0LabkOHY6zSHYNV) and, a loading dock fee.

You can add shipping rates in the Admin by using:

* The `Shipping strategy` page: you must upload the [shipping rate template](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127) when adding a `Shipping policy` or updating an existing one. We recommend this option for adding many postal codes and their shipping costs at a time. 
* The `Shipping rates` page: for when you want to update existing rates or add a few. It allows you to edit and add shipping rates without using the shipping rate template. To learn more, see our tutorial [Managing shipping rates](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-shipping-rates--tutorials_141).

>⚠️ The **[shipping rate template**](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127) is the only option for configuring the location polygon (geolocation), the **insurance cost** and **additional shipping costs**.

>ℹ️ If you need to update or add multiple shipping rates, we recommend using the [shipping rate template](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127) instead of the **Shipping rates** module. If you want to check out how shipping rates are added and displayed to the end customer, use the **[Shipping simulator**](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shipping-simulation--tutorials_144) module.
