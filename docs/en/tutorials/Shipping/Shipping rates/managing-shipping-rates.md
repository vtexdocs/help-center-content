Your store's [shipping rates](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/tarifas-de-envio--1Balpg3rv0854udEPedvMM) are the shipping cost options that will be offered to your customers. In the Admin, the **Shipping rates** module allows you to manage shipping rates individually using postal codes. In this module, you can:

* [Add shipping rates](#adding-shipping-rates).
* [Search for existing shipping rates](#searching-for-existing-shipping-rates).
* [Edit shipping rates](#editing-shipping-rates).
* [Delete shipping rates](#deleting-shipping-rates).

>ℹ️ If you need to update or add multiple shipping rates, we recommend using the shipping rate template instead of the **Shipping rates** module. If you want to check out how shipping rates are added and displayed to the end customer, use the [Shipping simulator](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/simulacao-de-frete--tutorials_144) module.

## Adding shipping rates

To add a new shipping rate, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Shipping > Shipping rates**, or type *Shipping rates* in the search bar at the top of the page.   
2. Click on the `New shipping rate` button.
3. Fill in the fields.
    * **Shipping policy**: select the [shipping policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140) to which the new rate will apply.
    * **Country**: country in which the carrier will make the delivery.
    * **Postal code range: **the postal code interval to which the new rate will apply. This field must be filled in only with numbers and/or letters.
    * **Weight range**: minimum and maximum shipment weight limits accepted by the carrier (considering the shipping rate and postal code specified). This field must be filled in with a decimal number. The weight unit (grams, kilograms, etc.) must be the same used when adding items (SKUs) to the catalog. 
    * **Shipping rate**: flat rate charged for making the delivery (considering the postal code and weight specified). This field must be filled in with a decimal number.
    * **Additional value**: the product’s percentage value that will be added to the shipping rate. For example, if the product costs US$ 80.00 and the additional value is 1 then an amount of US$ 0.80 will be added to the final shipping rate.<p>The percentage refers to the product’s total cost (the product price without discounts). This field must be filled in with a decimal number.For example, to add a percentage of 
23%, you can fill in the field with `23` or `23,00`.</p>
    * **Additional value per weight**: additional value for each unit that exceeds the minimum weight limit. This field must be filled in with a decimal number.
    * **Max. cubic volume:** the maximum volume accepted by the carrier. This field must be filled in with a decimal number.
