[VTEX Pick and Pack](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-pick-and-pack--1OOops3WrUyz7e0bnhkfXU) is a solution to streamline stores’ fulfillment processes by optimizing orders’ picking and packing, and the last-mile delivery. The solution is composed of the [Last Mile](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-pick-and-pack-last-mile--HN7WKV0xoq2ssVjsJlfzr) and **VTEX Pick and Pack Fulfillment** features, and appears in your VTEX Admin in **Apps**.

The **VTEX Pick and Pack Fulfillment** module is related to the order handling process and has the following sections:

* [Picking and Packing](#picking-and-packing)
* [Insights](#insights)
* [Settings](#settings)
* [Users](#users)

>❗ **VTEX Pick and Pack** is not an invoicing system. After picking and packing, the order must be invoiced and updated as `Invoiced` in the OMS, so that **VTEX Fulfillment** can end the picking and packing flow and proceed to shipping.

## Picking and Packing

This is the order management interface, with two main pages:

* [Picking and Packing list page](#picking-and-packing-list-page)
* [Picking and Packing details page](#picking-and-packing-details-page)

### Picking and Packing list page

When you access **Fulfillment > Picking and Packing**, you find a page listing all the orders that had the payment confirmed and are on the [order status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/order-flow-and-status--tutorials_196) `ready for handling`, as in the image below:

The table below contains a description of the columns:

| **Column** | **Description** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Created date | Order placement date and time. |
| Delivery date | Order shipping deadline, according to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) defined between the store and the customer. |
| Delivery method | Order shipping type, which can be delivery, send to customer’s address, or pickup from [pickup point](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pickup-points--2fljn6wLjn8M4lJHA6HP3R). |
| Order number | Unique ID that identifies an order, the same one used in the Order Management System (OMS). |
| Picker | Name of the picker assigned to the order. The picker is the person responsible for the picking process. The default value is `Unassigned` until a picker is assigned. |
| Status | Order status, which can be: <ul><li><b>Ready for handling:</b> Orders are ready for handling, but were not yet assigned to a picker.</li><li><b>Ready for picking:</b> The order was assigned to a picker and is depending on the picker’s confirmation to move to the next status.</li><li><b>Picking:</b> The picker is collecting the order items.</li><li><b>Ready for packing:</b> The picker has finished the picking process and the order is ready to be packed.</li><li><b>Packing:</b> The order’s items are being packed in bags or packages determined by the store.</li><li><b>Ready for invoicing:</b> The order can be invoiced. <i>VTEX Pick and Pack</i> solution does not invoice orders.</li><li><b>Invoiced:</b> The order was invoiced.</li><li><b>Prepare services:</b> Shipping services are ready to be created.</li><li><b>Ready for shipping:</b> The order is ready for shipping.</li><li><b>Delivered:</b> The order was delivered to the customer address or pickup point.</li><li><b>Idle:</b> The order was an external fulfillment, and <i>VTEX Pick and Pack</i> will not be able to process it. If the order is invoiced in OMS in a status different from <code>Ready for invoicing</code>, the system will also consider it an external fulfillment and change the order status to <code>Idle</code>.</li><li><b>Canceled:</b> The order was ready for handling, but was canceled.</li></ul> |

To view more details about an order, select one from the list and the information below will appear:

| **Column** | **Description** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Customer information | Customer’s name, email and contact number. |
| Delivery information | Customer’s address for delivery or pickup point address, when the customer is picking up from the store. |
| Delivery window | Shows the date the order was placed and the date the customer should receive it. |
| Order items | Number of items and their categories. |
| Payment method | Order's total amount and the [payment method](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/difference-between-payment-methods-and-payment-conditions--3azJenhGFyUy2gsocms42Q) used, like credit or debit cards. |

You can perform the following actions in the Picking and Packing page:

* [Search](#search)
* [Filter](#filter)
* [Import](#import)
* [Export](#export)
* [Print receipt](#print-receipt)

#### Search

On the top of the page, there is a search box with the magnifier icon <i class="fas fa-search"></i> in which you can search for orders using the following criteria:

* Order ID
* Customer name
* Store operator managing the order

#### Filter

You can filter orders using different criteria, and when you click `Filters`, a modal displays these options:

* **Sort Ascending/Descending:** Ascending sort makes the orders with the most recent delivery date and time set by customers at checkout appear first in the list. Descending sort organizes the list in the opposite way.
* **Order date:** Set a range to filter orders created within the chosen start and end date.
* **Due date:** Delivery deadlines occur within the chosen start and end date.

* **Payment method:** The [payment method](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/difference-between-payment-methods-and-payment-conditions--3azJenhGFyUy2gsocms42Q) used by the customer, like credit or debit cards.
* **Picker:** Picker assigned for the order picking process. Use available pickers’ emails.
* **Categories:** Orders items' categories, for example, _Beverage_ or _Clothes_. It depends on the store’s category tree configured in the Catalog.

If you wish to remove the selected filters, click `Filters`, and then click `Clear filters`.

#### Import

By default, orders in the `ready for handling` status should be automatically imported from OMS to Picking and Packing. If an order is not appearing on the fulfillment module, although is `ready for handling`, it could be due to manual changes to the order’s status in the OMS, and you can import it manually.

1. Click `Import`.
2. Enter the Order ID.
3. Select the checkbox _“Only orders that did not download automatically will be imported”_.
4. Click `Import`.

    * Start date
    * End date

3. Click `Export`.

## Insights

In **VTEX Pick and Pack**, the **Insights** page provides data and analytics about your orders during the fulfillment process. In that page, you will see two tabs: 

* [Picking and Packing](#insights-picking-and-packing)
* [Operation](#insights-operation)

>⚠️ To be able to access **Insights**, you need to have a VTEX Fulfillment Admin user profile, that is different from [roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc). For more information, see the [Users](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-pick-and-pack-fulfillment--1zGUEItEEVsal6cuBEBNcA#users) section.

### Insights: Picking and Packing

**Total orders** is a real time chart where you see information about all orders during a period in comparison to another. You can use multiple [filters](#insights-filters) to get different results.

#### Insights: Filters

You can combine multiple filters to filter the information you want to see in the charts, by accessing `Filters` on the top of the page. You can filter by the following criteria:

* Picker
* Delivery method
* Carrier
* City
* Seller

>ℹ️ The filter **Seller** is visible only for the account that operates as a marketplace. [White label sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa) do not have that filter option in **Insights**.

Besides the **Total orders** chart, there is a sequence of charts where you obtain data about _Payment methods_ and orders that were:

* Picked
* Shipped
* Delivered
* Cancelled

You can apply multiple filters to get different results.

#### Insights: Performance of categories and products

Below **Total orders**, you will find a chart about the number of orders and units bought and to what category they belong to. You can choose to group by `Categories` or `Products`.

### Insights: Operation

In the tab **Operation**, you will see the Picking and Packing **Order flow**, a chart with the total amount of orders distributed per day in the last seven days. The darker the blue, the more orders, the lighter the blue, the less.

>ℹ️ The Picking and Packing **Order flow** chart is calculated taking into account all orders of the last 7 days, and distributes them in hours, going from 0 to 23. Even if you change the period to 15 days, for example, the chart will remain fixed considering 7 days.

Below the **Order flow**, there is another chart with orders data filtered by picker. You will see information about:

* Orders
* Products
* Rejected products
* Fulfillment rate
* Average time

The page also provides charts related to the following topics:

* **Picked orders:** number of orders picked in the selected period.
* **Fulfillment rate:** percentage of orders picked within the minimum delivery due date. 
* **Time:** average time of the picking process.
* **Rejection reasons:** explanation of why a product was rejected.
* **Replacement reasons:** explanation of why a product was replaced.
* **Price change reason:** explanation of why a product has a price change.

If the first courier does not accept the task within the request expiration time, the task is sent to the second nearest courier and so on. If no courier accepts the task, it remains unassigned.
    * **Send to all:** All the couriers available in the task time zone receive the notification, limited to a maximum of 500 couriers. The task is assigned to the first courier that accepts it, and it stays unassigned until someone accepts it.
    * **Round robin:** Within a certain radius, a round robin — an algorithm for scheduling and assigning resources — is assigned to the courier, and you can select the following options:
        * Assign services to disconnected users
        * Restart assignment if the service is rejected
        * Prioritize couriers without services
        * Prioritize couriers with shorter delivery time

### Users and License Manager in VTEX Fulfillment

The **VTEX Pick and Pack** concept of _user_ is different from the common meaning of the term in VTEX. In **VTEX Fulfillment**, there are three types of users that participate in the fulfillment process - picker, customer service and admin. Usually, in VTEX, users are related to [roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) and [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3).

To access the **VTEX Fulfillment**, the admin and customer service users must have permissions related to License Manager resources. We recommend [creating a role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) identified as “_Fulfillment admin_”, which must have at least the following products and resources associated with it:

| **Product** | **Associated Resources** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Insights | <ul><li>Insights metrics</li></ul> |
| License Manager | <ul><li>Get account by identifier</li><li>Get applications</li><li>Find user by email</li><li>View users with account access</li><li>View all admin users</li><li>Get resource by key</li><li>Get role Get paged roles</li><li>Get paged users</li><li>Get admin status</li><li>Get accounts</li><li>Get accounts by host</li></ul> |
