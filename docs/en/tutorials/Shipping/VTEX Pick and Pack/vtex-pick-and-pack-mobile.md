The [VTEX Pick and Pack](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-pick-and-pack-fulfillment--1zGUEItEEVsal6cuBEBNcA) mobile app helps the picker — the person who picks and packs items in the facility — handle orders, from picking to shipping. This makes the store's order picking and delivery flow smoother and more efficient.

![pickpack-mobile-en](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4VZJd6qfgBB45lcqptQ5L9/c130518e5a14f76ca2ee9268bc298d92/image.png)

Order handling is divided into four steps, following the usual store order flow:

- [Create worksheets](#creating-worksheets)
- [Picking](#picking)
- [Packing](#packing)
- [Shipping](#shipping)

## Worksheets

A worksheet consists of a set of orders that will be processed by the Pick and Pack flow simultaneously. This allows for efficient management and speeds up the processing of multiple orders at once.

For example, a worksheet with only three orders:

- Order 1: A red t-shirt and a pink skirt.
- Order 2: Two red t-shirts and a white hat.
- Order 3: A pink skirt and a white hat.
When selecting this worksheet for handling, the app will display the following items for picking:

- Three red t-shirts.
- Two pink skirts.
- Two white hats.

The app will then help you pack each order with its respective items.

>⚠️ Worksheets only apply to the order picking and packing steps. You must ship each order separately.

## Creating worksheets

The __Unassigned__ tab lists the orders that should be selected for [worksheets](#worksheets).
