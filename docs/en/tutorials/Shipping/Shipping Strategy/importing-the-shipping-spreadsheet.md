>ℹ️ Warning: This documentation is being updated to reflect the concept change from Dashboards to [shipping strategy](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/estoque-e-entrega-entenda-o-que-mudou-na-aba-paineis--1YNfaeNG206XKI2UbGBRSl).


Before importing the data, it is important to have the VTEX model worksheet saved on your machine, that is, a spreadsheet __identical to our model worksheet__, including the cells formatting, with the header, and already in _.xls_ format (Excel 97-2003). To get the template, click on the __Spreadsheet Model Download link__, which is inside the carrier's settings screen.

1. Access the __Inventory & Shipping__ module
2. Click on __Dashboard__
3. Then, on the carrier you want to import the freight values from
4. Click on __Update spreadsheet__ then on __Choose file__
5. Select the previously saved file on your machine, with the specifications defined above
6. To finish, click on __Save__

After that, a color orange stripe will highlight the carrier included on the freight table, with the message _Processing_. The time of uploading depends on the size of the spreadsheet.

>⚠️ Remember that each new import overwrites the information that was imported before.

>⚠️ **1st Note:** If the 65,536 lines of the *.xls* version are insufficient for the registration of all freight values of the carrier, you must create a new tab, with the same header, on the same file, to continue filling out the information.

>⚠️ **2nd Note:**Pay attention to the file size. If it is bigger than 10MB, you will need to compress it with a *.zip* extension. This Zip file must also have 10MB tops for the upload to be successful. If somehow it still exceeds that limit, we recommend you to split it between more carriers.

## How to convert a shipping spreadsheet
