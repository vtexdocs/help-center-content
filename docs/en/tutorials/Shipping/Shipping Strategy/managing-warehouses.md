Warehouses are physical storage facilities for the ecommerce business. On the VTEX platform, you can add items to the warehouses you have configured in your store. Then you will be able to track items, their availability and manage their shipping through [loading docks](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-doca--7K3FultD8I2cuuA6iyGEiW) and [shipping policies](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/politica-de-envio--tutorials_140). 

>ℹ️ To better understand how the VTEX platform interprets and defines warehouse operations, check out our article [Warehouse](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estoque--6oIxvsVDTtGpO7y6zwhGpb).

In addition, you can add warehouses, the loading docks where products will be sent to, the processing time for transporting products from a warehouse to a loading dock, and the amount charged for handling them.

## Adding a warehouse

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Shipping > Shipping Strategy**, or type *Shipping Strategy* in the search bar at the top of the page.  
2. Go to the `Warehouses` tab.  
3. Click on the `Create warehouse` button.  
4. Check if the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> button is set to **Active** in the upper right corner. If not, toggle the button to **Active**.
5. Fill in the
[fields](#filling-in-warehouse-fields).
6. Then `Save changes`.

### Filling in warehouse fields

* **Name**: the name of the warehouse.
* **ID** (optional): the warehouse identifier. If this field is left empty, an ID will be created automatically.
* **Origin**: associates the warehouse with a loading dock. Select a [loading dock](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-doca--7K3FultD8I2cuuA6iyGEiW). 
    * Click on `Add loading dock`.
    * Select one or more loading docks using <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>.
    * Click on `Save changes`.
    * Once loading docks are selected, fill in the **Processing days and hours** field.

Select the number of days by clicking <i class="fas fa-minus"></i> and <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> and the minutes or hours in the <i class="far fa-clock"></i> field.
    * Fill in the **Extra fee** field if you want to charge any additional costs of handling orders from the warehouse to the loading dock.
