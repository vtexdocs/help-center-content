Nowadays, we have a limitation on the number of active promotions, taxes and coupons.

- [Promotions](/en/docs/tutorials/creating-promotions): 100
- [Taxes](/en/tutorial/creating-surchargestaxes): 100
- [Coupons](/en/tutorial/creating-a-coupon/): 50.000

Only active promotions, taxes or coupons are counted when calculating this limit, which means that archived promotions, taxes or coupons are not considered.

If it is necessary to change any of these limits, please contact our [Support](https://supporticket.vtex.com/support) to analyze the viability of the change.
