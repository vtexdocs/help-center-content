## Scheduling promotions

A promotion is scheduled when it is created (or modified) with a valid date and time later than the current date and time. The time considered is that of the computer system in which the promotion was created, regardless of time zone settings.

These promotions can be easily identified on the main Promotions page: they have an orange stripe with the word scheduled in the upper right corner of the card, as shown below.
