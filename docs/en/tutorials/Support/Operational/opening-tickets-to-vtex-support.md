All clients have access to support provided by the [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/como-funciona-o-suporte-da-vtex--3kACEfni4m8Yxa1vnf2ebe) team of specialists. Our specialists are qualified to provide the best possible experience to solve every ticket. To contact them, you must open a ticket through the ticket system.

In this article, we explain how clients can open tickets with VTEX Support and track their status.

This article is divided into four sections:

1. [Account authentication](#1-account-authentication)
2. [Getting started](#2-getting-started)
3. [What do you need?](#3-what-do-you-need)
4. [Tracking ticket status](#4-tracking-ticket-status)

## 1. Account authentication

In this initial step, you must authenticate your access to VTEX Support. To do this, please follow the steps below:

1. Access VTEX Support.
2. Choose an option to log in to your account. There are three available options:
   * Access by token, which is sent to the store’s email.
   * Login with Google.
3. Login using email and password, which requires [2-step authentication](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/habilitar-login-por-autenticacao-de-2-fatores) by app or SMS.

After authentication, you will be redirected to the next step.

## 2. Getting started

After authenticating your account, the support team will require some personal details for identification. You must fill in the required fields below.

1. Fill in the **Name** field with your name and surname.
2. In the **Account** field, select the option that matches the store for which you are requesting support.
3. Click `Continue` to move on to the next step.

## 3. What do you need?

After the identification is completed, you must select the type of help your store needs from VTEX Support. There are three options:

- [Technical](#technical)
- [Financial](#financial)
- [Commercial](#commercial)

### Technical

Technical support helps the user solve issues or answer technical queries regarding the platform. 

If you choose this option, you are required to fill in the information described in the following step-by-step instructions:

1. In the **Problem type field**, describe the type of problem you need help with. There are three possible options:
   * *The store is experiencing a problem or has an unexpected behavior*
   * *I have a concern and would like to ask a question*
   * *I would like to request a setup*
2. In the **Request subject** field, fill in the information about the type of problem you need help with. Based on your problem description, we will indicate some articles from the [Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/en/) that might help you solve your problem. If none of these articles can help you solve your problem, please move on to the next step.

10. We suggest you leave the option **I agree to anonymously share my problem/question resolution with VTEX** selected. By doing so, you increase the impact of the solution by preventing other stores in the VTEX ecosystem from experiencing the same problem.

## 4. Tracking ticket status

Once you have opened a ticket, you can track it in the [Request history](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) available in VTEX Support. On the Request history page, you will find a search field. You may find your requests by entering the ticket ID or by using the filter with the available statuses.

After a ticket is created, it will be automatically displayed on the panel with the status `Open`.

Tickets may have the following statuses:

- **Open:** Ticket assigned to a support agent who is working on solving it. 
- **Pending:** Ticket assigned to a support agent who is waiting for the client to send further information by email.
- **Solved:** Ticket that was marked as solved by the support agent or the client. Once the ticket is solved, the client has 27 hours to re-open it by answering to the email sent to them by the Support team or by accessing the Request history. On the contrary, the ticket will be closed.
- **Closed:** Ticket that was marked as Solved and, since there wasn't any interaction after 27 hours, was automatically closed. It cannot be reopened.

Once tickets are solved, the support team sends an email to the user with a link to a [Satisfaction survey](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/avalie-o-atendimento-da-vtex-pelo-seu-admin--7rSJLgGbtRw2GhjTJezkJf). This survey allows us to assess the service provided by our support team without leaving the VTEX environment and it helps us improve our client's experience.
