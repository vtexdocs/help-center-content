We believe that the following guidelines, although basic in nature, are fundamental to our objective. They apply to the use of all resources within the forums/chat rooms, and in our efforts to provide you with a valuable resource, VTEX will impose measures to ensure communication that is honest, respectful and productive. Please do your part to help us maintain this constructive environment by following these guidelines and encouraging your colleagues to do the same.

### Honesty

This says it all! We want to hear what you have to say. What are our strengths? What do we have to change? Provide us with honest feedback about the things we do well, and constructive criticism of the things that could do with improvement. We greatly value your opinion, in addition to it helping us to provide the community with more effective support.

### Respect

Say what you think, but please say it in a constructive manner. The comments you post, whether in the forums/chat rooms or in connection with any Help Center content, must refrain from demonstrating intolerance or offense towards other groups or individuals. We encourage you to be open, but we cannot condone using this community in disrespect to others or by offensive behavior.

### Productivity

Use the web wisely. Do you have a question (however complex it is)? Ask around and challenge your colleagues! Do you have an interesting idea for a new functionality, or you need help in planning your application? Get in touch with us! However, please do not deliberately post content not intended for the VTEX platform or its applications, or which stands in the way of effective use by the community. Please communicate only in ways that respect the time and energy of everyone else.
