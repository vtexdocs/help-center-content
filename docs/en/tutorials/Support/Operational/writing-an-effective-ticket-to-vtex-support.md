To learn how to open a ticket to VTEX Support, see [Opening tickets to VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/opening-chamados-para-o-tickets-to-vtex-support).

## Before opening a ticket

Before opening a ticket, check whether the problem is related to the store's customizations. If the source of the problem is a customization, you'll need to contact your customization team. Otherwise, open a ticket to VTEX Support.

### Cart, Checkout and CMS Stores

It is important to validate whether the scenario occurs without customizing the store. To run this test, disable customizations (JS and CSS) and try to reproduce the error. Learn more about this in the article[Blocking customizations to troubleshoot frontend issues](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/como-bloquear-customizacoes-para-investigar-problemas-no-front-end-da-loja--5c1a4bvVK8rAvKLczhkCnY)  If the error persists, please contact our [Support team](https://help.vtex.com/support?/cultureInfo=pt-br).

### Store Framework
To check if the problem is associated with IO, follow the steps below:

1.	Open the command prompt and log in to your store using the [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference).
2. Access a development workspace by running the following command:
    ```
    vtex use {workspace}
    ```
3.	If your store has a Store Framework theme installed, uninstall it using the command below:
    ```
    vtex uninstall {theme}
    ```

    >ℹ️ You can check for any installed themes using the `vtex list` command, which lists all the applications installed in the store.

4.	Clone the default Store Framework theme on your computer.
5.	At the command prompt, access the default theme folder.
6.	Run the command:
    ```
    vtex link
    ```
    >⚠️ If your store doesn't have the Reviews and Ratings app installed, you may receive an error when trying to create the link. To avoid this, remove this app from the `peer dependencies` list in the `manifest.json` file of the default theme.

7.	Access your workspace's storefront using the URL:
    ```
    https://{workspace}--{accountName}.myvtex.com
    ```
8.	Try to reproduce the error.

If the error does not occur after blocking the files or in the default Store Framework theme, it means that the error is related to the site's customizations. To solve it, you should contact the team responsible for your store's frontend.
