In order to request the change of CNPJ and transfer the rights, obligations and contractual liability of your store, you must open a [ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) communicating your decision to the financial team.

## Make sure your ticket contains the following information:

- CNPJ card of both the current and the new contractor.
- Social Contract of both the current and the new contractor.
- Full data of the __current and new__ legal representatives, who will sign the transfer document (Name / RG / CPF / Email).
