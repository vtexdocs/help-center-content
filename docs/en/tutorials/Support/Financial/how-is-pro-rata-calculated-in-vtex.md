In the market for services and collections, the pro rata is a proportional value from the day of installation/change in the hired service until the beginning of its collection period.

The discount calculation goes like this: `monthly fee divided by the number of days of the month of hiring times unused days`

So if your monthly payment had a value of $ 750 in May - 31 days - and you hired VTEX on May 6, you would be deducted $ 145.16 on your next bill.

The calculation was: `$ 750/31 = $ 24,19 x 3 (days) = $ 145,16`
