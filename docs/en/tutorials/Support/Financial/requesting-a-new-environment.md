To request a new VTEX environment, contact our Growth Operations team through *[Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support)* by selecting **Commercial** and `Create an additional environment`. Learn more about it by reading the article ["Opening tickets to VTEX support"](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/abrir-chamados-para-o-suporte-vtex--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM).

The additional cost for this environment is specified in your contract. If not, please mention it in your request so that we can add an amendment to your contract.

You must fill in the following information:

- Master User email
- Additional account name
- Type of business of the new account:
   * QA
   * B2C
   * B2B
   * B2B+B2C
   * B2E
   * MKP B2E
   * MKP B2B
- What is the estimated Go Live date?
- Who is the implementation partner? In case there is no partner, please write `own development`.
- What is the estimated revenue from this account in the next 12 months?

When there is a need to register an ecommerce independent of the existing one, we recommend the [multistore](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-criar-multiloja-multidominio--tutorials_510) configuration to differentiate the storefront (association of the same catalog to a different URL domain). There is no additional cost for configuring the multi-store.
