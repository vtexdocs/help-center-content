[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is a package manager that can be used as an alternative to npm for the installation of the VTEX IO CLI.

To install the CLI through yarn, enter the terminal and type `yarn global add vtex`.

With that, you'll install the VTEX IO CLI globally and you'll be able to login to your account.
