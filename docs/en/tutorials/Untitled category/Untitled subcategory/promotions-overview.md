A promotion is a discount granted to the customer on one or more products in the cart or on the shipping cost, or even a gift. On VTEX, the retailer can create a series of rules that, depending on the context of the purchase, will determine if and how the discount will be applied. 

In the **Promotions** menu of your redesigned Admin you can set up a promotion restricted to certain product lists, customer lists, zip code ranges, minimum cart value, and more.

Check out the menuâ€™s different sections and pages below.

## Promotions

In this section you will be able to create promotions, campaign audience, gift cards, and taxes.  This section includes the following page already in the new design:

- [Promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/lista-de-promocoes--5LtzPm5kQdRVI06KXHE0Td): discounts offered to customers based on specific criteria.   

Soon to be included in the redesigned Admin:

- [Campaign audience](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-campaign-audiences--6cnuDZJzIkIeocewAQQK4K): definitions of target audience that can be used as a promotion criterion.   
- [Gift cards](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gift-card--tutorials_995): considered a payment method on the VTEX platform.   
- [Tax](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-surchargestaxes--tutorials_321): an additional percentage added to the price of the product, aiming to increase the value.
