__Device Fingerprint__ is an identifier that acts in payment processing to improve fraud risk analysis. 

By collecting non-sensitive data, Device Fingerprint identifies and analyzes the security level of the device used to perform a given transaction. It also analyzes transactions previously performed with that device.

>ℹ️ Each store must have only one Device Fingerprint registered. Check if you have already registered the Device Fingerprint in another connector, before proceeding with the steps below.

This article will explain how to associate the Device Fingerprint feature with the Mercado Pago affiliation.

1. Access the VTEX __Admin__.
2. In the __Store Setup__ section, click on __Checkout__.
3. In __Default__, click on the blue gear icon.
4. Go to the __Code__ tab.
5. In the right side of the page, under __Files__, select one of the following options:

- If you use checkout V5, select __checkout5-custom.js__.
- If you use checkout V6, select __checkout6-custom.js__.

<ui>
6. In the field that will appear, delete the warning message and enter the following code:
  </ui>

```
var script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://www.mercadopago.com/v2/security.js";
script.setAttribute("output","vtex.deviceFingerprint");
script.setAttribute("view","checkout");
document.body.appendChild(script);
console.log("MP-deviceId 2020 " + script.getAttribute("output").value );
```

<ui>
  Click on <b>Save</b> to apply the code to checkout.  
  </ui>

Once you have completed the steps above, you will have Device Fingerprint installed in your store.

## Checking Device Fingerprint operation

To ensure the Device Fingerprint feature is operating properly, you must analyze the details of an order placed using Mercado Pago as a payment method. Follow the steps below:

1. Go to the VTEX __Admin__.
2. In the __Payments__ module, click on __Transactions__.
3. Select the most recent transaction paid via Mercado Pago. 
4. Click on __+ Information__.
5. Search for the __deviceFingerprint__ field and check if the code starts with the word armor, as illustrated below.

<ui>
6. Then, send the transaction ID to the Mercado Pago support team. You can find this ID in the <b>authorizationConnectorResponse</b> field.
  </ui>

![Authorization](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5FTRfpgGc7HJZUNaZicEb4/1d84e9df5bb987aa4b3acf9a0f1904e1/AUTHORIZATION.png)

<ui>
7. Copy the ID and <a href=https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/support>send an email</a> with this information to Mercado Pago requesting them to validate the transaction. 
  </ui>

Once you have received Mercado Pago’s confirmation, Device Fingerprint will be ready to be used in your store.
