Over the past several months, we have been investing in a major evolution of our product: bringing a world-class user experience and clean modern design to our admin panel. 

Our goal is to bring consistency to the overall experience, decreasing unnecessary complexity and fixing significant localization gaps. Admin v4 will be simpler to use, fully localized, and give users the ability to quickly bring the full value of our products to their business.

To achieve this, we are redesigning multiple parts of the experience and making structural changes. But we don't want to wait until everything is done to start delivering improvements to our customers. That is why, for a select group of customers, we are offering early access to our first release in beta: a refreshed home page and improved navigation. 

## Improved navigation 
Everything you need to manage your VTEX store is still available in Admin v4, only now with a more straightforward organization. Our left and top navigation menu were rebuilt from scratch, grouping similar categories in a clearer way to reduce distractions and help your team find what they need faster. It is also possible to use the search bar to find specific sections on the menu.

### Information Center
This is where we group all useful links from our VTEX ecosystem, to help you get the best out of our VTEX platform. By clicking on the `?` button on the top bar, you can access our Help Center, blog, Developer Portal, Platform Status and support pages.

### Store Settings
For this new experience, we have grouped all settings, from all sections under a specific tab: Store Settings. Through this improvement, you can easily access all settings that affect every service in your account.

### Profile Settings
Your profile avatar, on the upper right corner now hosts all the settings related to your user and account. Through the avatar you can access user settings, account settings, billing information, change your Admin’s locale,  switch to the Admin’s previous version and logout of your account and logout. Through this improvement, we separated your profile settings from the configurations that affect your actual store. Now you have more control and visibility over actions that affect your business, and those that affect your profile.

## Refreshed home page

Our admin home page was redesigned to give you a high level overview of your store at a glance – like a cockpit for your digital commerce operations. That is why it is now called **Dashboard**.

As soon as you log in to Admin v4, you will see useful metrics and charts to monitor your store's performance, such as revenue and number of orders, sales funnel and conversion rates, and your top 10 highest grossing products. Check out all components on the new Dashboard, and learn how they work, looking through the list below.

- **Orders:**  number of orders placed.  All data about orders and revenue comes from VTEX’s Order Management System.  
- **Sessions:** Number of visits to store  
- **Revenue:** total revenue your store has received until the present day.  
- **Average Ticket:** the average revenue per order.   
- **Sales Funnel:** graph that displays the customer’s journey, pointing out user turnover from one step of the journey to the next. Steps present in the funnel include visiting the store, viewing a product, adding it to cart, submitting the payment and completing the order.   
- **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of sessions that turned into orders.   
- **Order Trend Analysis:** graph displaying the tendency of orders placed, compared to data from the previous 3 months.    
- **Highest Grossing Products:** top 10 highest grossing products in  your store in the last 30 days.   
- **Recommendations for you:** action-based recommendations to increase your store’s performance or fix issues.  
- **Product news:** the latest product news and updates from VTEX.  
- **Shortcuts:** quick links to commonly visited sections in the Admin.  

All data on the dashboard is updated every five minutes, and once you compare periods, the system considers data from 00 AM on the start date, to the present date and time, in your computer’s time zone.

## Welcome to our Beta
While we refreshed our admin panel,your store settings and data have not changed. All the information previously found in your account remains the same. No further setup is required – your account will be automatically upgraded to the new experience.

Throughout the entire Beta Program, you can count on our team to support your experience and answer any questions.
