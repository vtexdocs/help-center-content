Marketplace Network makes it easier for marketplaces and sellers operating in the VTEX ecosystem to find each other and communicate, opening up the possibility of new business and mutual growth for everyone involved. The feature works as a catalog of parties interested in partnerships, allowing sign up, inquiries, and contact between marketplaces and sellers for signing commercial agreements.

Note that Marketplace Network is a tool that promotes interaction between potential partners, but it is not a requirement to become a marketplace or seller on VTEX.

## Finding Sellers and Marketplaces

To see the list of available marketplaces and sellers, go to *Marketplace > Marketplace Network > Find Sellers / Find Marketplaces*. On both pages, you can search by keyword and filter the list for more exact results, as well as contact potential partners.

## Contact

The Find Marketplace and Find Seller pages allow direct contact with potential partners. By clicking on their profile in the list, you can access their details. Keep in mind that you can only send a message after you have activated your profile. 

When sending a message, consider all the information that that seller or marketplace needs to know to connect with your business. We also suggest touching on possible questions or points that would be relevant for a future meeting, for example. 

To contact a member:

1. In the Marketplace section of your store, click __Marketplace Network__.    
2. Click the __Find Sellers__ or the __Find Marketplaces__ page.     
3. In the list, click the __profile__ of a potential partner.     
4. Fill the **Send a message** field.    
5. Click the __Send__ button.     

>ℹ️ The potential business partner will receive an email with the information you entered. If both parties are interested, the person in charge of the seller or marketplace may contact you and negotiate a marketplace and seller agreement.
