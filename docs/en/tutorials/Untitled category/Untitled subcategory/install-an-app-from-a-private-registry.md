By default, when you install an app using the `vtex install` command, what you're doing is fetching that app from the public Registry, which is accessible to any user.

But you can also install an app from a private Registry.

To do this, simply use one of the two commands below, replacing `{account}` with the name of the desired Registry account.

`vtex install -r {account}` or `vtex install --registry {account}`
