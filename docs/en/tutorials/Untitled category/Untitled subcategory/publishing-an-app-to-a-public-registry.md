By default, the `vtex publish` command publishes the app to the Registry of your current account, which makes it accessible only to users of that account.

To make your app public, and therefore available to any user with access to the Extension Store, you need to publish it on the __Public Registry__.

To do this, use one of the following commands:

`vtex publish --public` or `vtex publish -p`
