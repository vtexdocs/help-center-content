When you publish an app, what you're doing is registering it. That is, you're making it available for others to install it if they want.

Therefore, an app is published after the developer finishes working on it and wants to make it available for third-party use.

An app can be published in the Registry of the account where you are working or in the public Registry.

If it's published to your account's Registry, it will only be available to users with access to that account.

But if it's published to the public Registry, it can be installed by any user visiting the Extension Store.
