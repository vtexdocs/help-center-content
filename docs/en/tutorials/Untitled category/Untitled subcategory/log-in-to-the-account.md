To sign in to the store account, enter the terminal and type:

`vtex login`

The terminal will request the Account, that is, the account name of the store.

![vtex login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_1.png)

After entering the Account, inform the password, if necessary, and that's it: you're signed in to your account!
