Recently, the **Conditional Prices** feature was added to the *Pricing* module. (Read the article [How to create Conditional Prices](/en/tutorial/how-to-create-conditional-prices).)

With this new feature, we now have a new price entity called *Conditional Prices*, besides the existing ones *Fixed Price* and *Base Price*.

Below we have an illustration showing how this price waterfall works:

When a price for a specific SKU is requested to the *Pricing* module:
1. A *Fixed Price* is selected according to its criteria like **scheduling** and **minimum quantity**.
2. It checks if there is any *Conditional Price* defined and if it applies to the user that is buying. If there is, the *Conditional Price* is delivered.
3. If no *Conditional Price* was defined, or if it doesn't apply to the user, the *Fixed Price* is delivered.
4. If no *Fixed Price* is active, then the *Base Price* is delivered.
5. If there is no *Base Price* defined, the SKU will be shown as **inactive** on the shelf.

**Notes:**
* If more than 1 *Conditional Prices* applies to an user, the delivered price will be the cheapest.
* The *Fixed Price* can contain at most **3 conditional prices**.
