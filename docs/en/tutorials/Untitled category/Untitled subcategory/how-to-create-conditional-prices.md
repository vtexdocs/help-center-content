>⚠️ **Note: **
> In order to use Conditional Prices you have to first install the **Conditions Builder** app and create a condition there. (Read the article [How to use Conditions Builder App](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-use-conditions-builder-app))


Conditional prices are managed in the pricing module.

Inside a price table, you can define *Fixed prices*, and within a Fixed price you can define __Conditional Prices__ . (At the moment, you can add up to 3 Conditional Prices per Fixed Price)  

So here is a step by step showing how you can use this feature :

1. Go to Pricing admin ({{yourAccountName}}.myvtex.com/admin/pricing)
2. Select a price table of a SKU
3. Add a fixed price or edit an existing one
4. Click on "Set conditional prices"
5. Select a *Condition* and set a *Price* 
6. You can define a short message, called *Teaser*, to promote this condition to your customers. (To learn more, see [Teasers - Coming Soon])
7. Save it
