When a product is added to the cart, the amounts charged for each tax previously set up will be charged. To calculate the tax, it is necessary to fill in the customerâ€™s data and purchase delivery data. Taxes will be always specified on the checkout page. The party responsible for the store will also have the information on Orders Management.
