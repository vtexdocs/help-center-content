The Registry is a repository for versioned apps.

So, the moment they publish an app, what the developer is doing is sending this app to a Registry.

This Registry may be:
- __public__: accessible by any user.
- __private__: only users with access to the account of this Registry can access or install the apps published on it.

In the same way, everything that is installed comes from a Registry.

You can not install an app that is published in the private registry of another account.
