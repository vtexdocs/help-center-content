Each VTEX account has a single [Sponsor user](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRBfHerya6I0XQiSyVTICPz8kqzADJbHdWuZm7ARlpQ/edit#) – the only one who is granted full access to every section in the Admin, including critical maintenance and authorization actions. By default, this role is assigned to a user specified in your contract, usually the person overseeing digital commerce operations on a daily basis.

The current Sponsor user may transfer this responsibility to anyone they desire through the [Sponsor management]() page, by following the [steps in the ownership transfer flow](). If they are unavailable, a legal representative for the company may fill out a form to request a manual store ownership transfer under [exceptional circumstances](). The current Sponsor user can also check the activity log for all ownership transfers that have been made since the creation of the VTEX account.

## Sponsor management

The Sponsor management page allows you to identify the current Sponsor user, transfer store ownership and view the activity log associated with Sponsor user actions. To access this page, navigate to _Account settings > Account management > Users_, scroll down to the Contact section and click on the Sponsor Management link. 

You should see a screen that is similar to the image below, with contact information for the current Sponsor user, a disclaimer indicating the risks associated with transferring store ownership and a button that allows you to acknowledge the risks and transfer ownership anyway.

## Steps in the ownership transfer flow

Before you start, make sure the user who will be granted the Sponsor role already has access to the account. If they don't, you should [create a new user](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/managing-users--tutorials_512#creating-a-new-user) for them before you proceed.

To transfer store ownership, the current Sponsor user must:

* Navigate to [Sponsor management]() and click **Transfer Anyway**;
* Fill in the email address for the new Sponsor user and click **Next**;
* Read and agree to the terms by selecting the checkbox and click **Send Invite**.

This will send an email to the new Sponsor user, which expires in 48 hours. The current Sponsor user may cancel or resend the invitation while it is still awaiting confirmation.

To accept the invitation, the new Sponsor user must:

* Find the email that was sent to his inbox and click **See invitation**;
* Log in to the Admin for the account associated with the invitation;
* Read and agree to the terms by selecting the checkbox and click **Accept Invite**.

This will complete the ownership transfer – cancelling the invitation will no longer be possible. If there was an issue with the completed transfer, you may request support to revert or modify the transfer under [exceptional circumstances]().

## Auditing store ownership changes

The Sponsor user is responsible for critical maintenance and authorization actions, and mistakes made by this user role can have drastic consequences. Therefore, it is essential to track  changes related to this user role. To monitor and audit  account ownership transfers, you can access the activity log on the Sponsor management page by clicking on the **Activity Log** button. 

![Activity Log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Untitled%20category/Untitled%20subcategory/transferring-store-ownership_2.gif)

All events related to the transfer of account ownership are logged in the activity log with the date they occurred and the user associated with the event.

## Exceptional circumstances

In the event that the current Sponsor is not willing or able to initiate an ownership transfer, you may request support to grant access to a legal representative specified in the contract. 

To request a manual ownership transfer, [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/osXEnKJFMe7ZK3yx6) and send a copy of the company's articles of association to [sales-operations@vtex.com](mailto:sales-operations@vtex.com). Our team will then make an addendum to the contract, which must be signed by the legal representative, formalizing the transfer of the responsibility for the Sponsor user.

Keep in mind that if the user appointed in the form does not match the legal representative seen in the articles of association, you must also send a notarized power of attorney informing that the representative named in the transfer request form is authorized to sign the request.
