By default, the minimum quantity of items in the cart is 1 item. However, it is possible to change this value and specify the number that the store believes is ideal for your business.

For example, if you change the number from 1 *(default)* to 2, this will prevent the customer from completing the purchase without having added at least 2 items to the cart.

To change the minimum quantity of items in the cart, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access __Store Settings > Orders > Settings__, or type __Settings__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the __General__ tab, __Cart__ section, adjust the value of the __Minimum number of items in cart__ field as desired.
3. Click `Save`.
