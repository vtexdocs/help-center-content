The product registration can be done through the Admin, through spreadsheet or through the ERP. Before creating a product, you should have already created a brand and a category for it.


Follow the step by step to create your products using __Admin __:

1. Access the __Catalog__ module.
2. Hover your mouse over the __Products Management__ tab.
3. Click __Products and SKUs__.
4. Then, in __Products and SKUs Management__.
5. Click __Add Product__.
6. [Fill in the fields](/en/tutorial/product-registration-fields) for the product.
7. To finish, click __Save__.
8. If you want to register your SKUs then click __Save and register__.


Follow the step by step to create your products using __spreadsheet__:

1. Access the __Catalog__ module.
2. Hover your mouse over the __Products Management__ tab.
3. Click __Products and SKUs__.
4. Then, click __Import/Export Products and SKUs__.
5. Click __Export/Import__.
6. Click on the __Import__ tab.
7. You can download the spreadsheet to check or change your products.
8. [Fill in the spreadsheet fields](/en/tutorial/filling-in-fields-in-the-import-spreadsheet).
9. Go back to the Admin and __upload the file__ with the .xls extension.
10. Depending on the quantity of products, their processing can be time consuming. After it ends, you will receive the import confirmation in your email.


The product registration through __ERP__ can be done in 2 ways:

[Quick Catalog Integration](/en/tutorial/integration-guide-for-erps-express-catalog), that is, an express integration, only with the basic and necessary flows.

[Full Catalog Integration](/en/tutorial/integration-guide-for-erps-full-catalog), that is, a complete integration, with most of the existing flows.

See which of the integrations best suits your store and your workflow.
