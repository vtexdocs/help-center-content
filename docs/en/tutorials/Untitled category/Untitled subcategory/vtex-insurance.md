**VTEX Insurance** is an app that enables merchants to bind store products to insurance offers provided by their insurance partner [Assurant](https://www.assurant.com.br/). This feature allows your store to provide customized insurance to customers, offering financial protection in case of failure or defect of the purchased product or service. You can provide your customers with an extra layer of security with an extended warranty.

Once the payment is confirmed, your customer will receive an email from our support team with the purchased insurance document. This document is a receipt that confirms the purchased product is insured and contains all the information describing the insurance coverage, including instructions to contact the insurance company.

Check out the table below to see the insurance types available in VTEX Insurance.

Code   | Insurance Type
--------- | ------
EW | Extended Warranty
TH | Theft and Qualified Theft
RQ | Theft and Accidental Damage
QA | Accidental Damage

2. [Create a collection](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-collections-beta--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye) to group products for binding the insurance options. You need to create a specific collection for each insurance type, as the collection will be used to specify which insurance policy the products will belong to.

3. [Create a category specification group](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-a-specification-group-in-a-category--tutorials_246) to add manufacturer warranties to your catalog, such as Warranty.

4. [Create a product specification](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-specifications-or-product-fields--tutorials_106) with the insurance information you want to provide, such as Extended Warranty, for example.

8. [Create insurance SKUs](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sku-registration-fields--21DDItuEQc6mseiW8EakcY). We recommend creating more than three SKUs for each insurance.![Insurance - SKUs](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/7z6EX1cFT3l5wmnlX5LQk1/e1b53a46f844d679277074c59386b0de/image3.png)
