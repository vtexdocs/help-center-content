The __Maximum Price per item__ promotion is used to set a maximum price for a product or set of products.

You can create up to __10 promotions__ of this type, with a __limit of 100 SKUs__ in each of them, where each SKU will have its individual and exclusive maximum price.

As it's a benefit, the prices registered at maximum prices can not be higher than the product's price.

>⚠️ **Attention:** In order for the Maximum price per item to work, you must **choose a payment method**.

## General promotion data

- __Name__: Promotion name.
- __Status__: Activate or deactivate the promotion.
- __Description__: Internal description of the promotion. This field should be used for internal communication in your store, to make it clear if the promotion is due to some campaign, for instance.
- __Expiration date__: Date and time of start and end of the promotion. A future date and/or time can be used for the promotion. If it's configured this way, it will have the status "scheduled" until the date and time are reached. While the promotion is valid, it will have the status "active". At the end of the set date and time, the status will be changed to inactive automatically. It's important to note that the system uses the date and time of the user who made the scheduling as a reference.
- __Specify days of the week for activation__: This option is of type checkbox. When checked, seven additional checkboxes become available for you to select the days of the week that the promotion will be applied. If you want the promotion to be applied on any day of the week, do not select this option.
- __Featured in the product__: Inserts a flag with the name of the promotion. Used in the shop window and on the product page. This flag will only be inserted if the `<vtex.cmc:discountHightLight/>` control is used in the template. This control displays the promotion flag on the desired page.
- __Restrict this benefit the products of these Sellers__: On the right side of the screen, fill in the name of the sellers whose products will receive the discount. This option allows you to condition a different discount for each seller.
- __Sales Policy__: Select the sales policies that will offer this discount. You can offer discounts for sales policies where [your store is the marketplace](/en/faq/what-is-a-marketplace) (*provided by me (My store)*) or the [seller](/en/faq/what-is-a-seller) (*Delivered by me (Other stores)*).

## Maximum price per item
