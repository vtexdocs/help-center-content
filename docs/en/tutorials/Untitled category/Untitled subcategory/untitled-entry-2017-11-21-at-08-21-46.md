VTEX IO is an invitation for the ecosystem to evolve the development of e-commerce tools with us.

VTEX excels in this ecosystem by, among other things, a solid and agile infrastructure, which allows an architecture divided into micro-services, and a number of monthly deploys around 800.

With IO, we will further evolve this infrastructure, taking with us the whole ecosystem of partners.

Instead of releasing microsservicios, we will install __apps__.

Instead of 800 deploys a month, we'll get somewhere around __10 thousand__.

And the e-commerce ecosystem will have a more agile and customizable platform.
