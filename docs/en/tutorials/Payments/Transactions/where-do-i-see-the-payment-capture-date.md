The date and time of settlement of a payment can be viewed in the transaction timeline.

To do that, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Orders** > **Transactions**, or type **Transactions** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Find the desired transaction and click on it.
3. In the __Transaction Events__, look for the settlement event:
