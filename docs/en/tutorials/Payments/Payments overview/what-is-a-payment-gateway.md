A __gateway__ (also called payment gateway) is a system that transmits the data of purchases made in your store. 

It's responsible for sending this information to acquirers, card brands and [issuing banks](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-issuing-bank) then obtain a response about the continuation of the process or its cancellation. 

In other words, the gateway sends data and receives responses so that you know whether or not a particular purchase should be confirmed.

VTEX platform has its own gateway with [PCI](/en/faq/what-is-the-pci-ssc) certification, which means that data on all payments made in your store is protected according to high security standards. 

By activating the [connectors](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-connector) and registering [gateway affiliations](/en/tutorial/registering-gateway-affiliations/), your clients' shopping data can be sent to acquirers or other gateways and thus move on through the approval flow in financial institutions.
