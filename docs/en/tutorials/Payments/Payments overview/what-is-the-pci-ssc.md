PCI Security Standards Council is a global forum open to continuous development, enhancement, storage, dissemination and implementation of data protection security standards.

It was founded by American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard and Visa Inc.

PCI SSC is a certification given by that institution, through which VTEX guarantees the safety of its services. It brings security information that we make available for the stores and your customers. 

For more information, see the [VTEX PCI SSC certification category](https://vtex.com/us-en/compliance/certifications/).
