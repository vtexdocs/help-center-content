A digital wallet (also called an ewallet) is a secure environment where bank and/or credit card information can be stored. This information is encrypted in the system and, when accessed by its owner, can be used to make purchases on the internet.

Buying with a digital wallet offers more security for the user since they don't need to enter their payment information at the store checkout. Instead, the user is redirected to the digital wallet environment, where they must undergo authentication steps.

After teh identity is confirmed and the payment method is chosen, the purchase returns to normal the flow and the order is completed. Some digital wallets also function as sub-acquirers, allowing even a non-registered person to be able to purchase through their environment.

These are some examples of e-wallets that can be configured to make payments in your VTEX store: __Paypal__, __Mercado Pago__, __PagSeguro__, __Stelo__, among others.
