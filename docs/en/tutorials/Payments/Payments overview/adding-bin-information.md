The Bank Identification Number (BIN) consists of the first six or eight digits of a credit or debit card and identifies the card's issuing institution.

When a banking institution wants to create new card profiles or issue new cards for an existing model, new BINs are required. This also applies when a card [brand](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-credit-card-brand--4bNba5QYuIwKEmac88KwyI) is acquired by another.

In such cases, VTEX must be notified to ensure that the new cards are correctly validated during the payment process for purchases made on the platform.

## Submitting an add BIN request

To add a new BIN or update an existing one on VTEX, please open a ticket with [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).

In the ticket, you should attach a spreadsheet with the following information:

- __code__: New BIN to be added or existing BIN to be updated.
- __cardBrand__: Card brand of the BIN.
- __cardType__: Type of card (credit or debit).
- __country__: Country where the card will be used.
- __bank__: Issuing bank of the card.
- __cvvSize__: Number of characters in the CVV (Card Verification Value).
