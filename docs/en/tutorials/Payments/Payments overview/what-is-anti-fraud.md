Anti-fraud is a system specialized in analyzing the purchases made on the websites, in order to identify fraudulent transactions. 

It collects data about the behavior of users and compares them with suspicious patterns to then approve or deny the order. Thus, the anti-fraud adds an extra layer of security to your store.

At VTEX, the payment operator first approves the purchase and then the anti-fraud assesses the order. If everything goes OK, it follows its normal flow.
