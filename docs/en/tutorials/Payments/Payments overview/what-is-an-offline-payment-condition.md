Offline payment conditions are those that need a customer action outside of the store environment so that the transaction can follow its flow. Essentially, they follow three stages:

1. The customer chooses an offline payment condition.
2. Your website generates the information so hat payment is made to the bank.
3. The bank informs your store that the payment has been received.

With that, your store has control over the transaction and may complete the customer's order.

An example that illustrates this type of situation is the bank slip, which is issued by you, but must be paid directly to the bank (either at an agency, an ATM or a smartphone application) before the product is shipped for delivery.
