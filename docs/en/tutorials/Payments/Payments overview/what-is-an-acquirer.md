An __acquirer__ is a company that specializes in processing payments. Through its network of accredited partners (or acquiring network), it enables a store to offer various payment conditions to its customers. 

In exchange, the __acquirer__ receives the payment information, processes it and passes it to the [card brand](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-credit-card-brand) (when the payment method is credit card) and the [issuing bank](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-issuing-bank).

For your store to be able to receive payments, you must enable its communication with an __acquirer__. This is done through a [payment gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway), which must be configured to process the [payment conditions](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions). With that, purchases can follow the approval flow.

When everything is in order and a purchase is authorized by the other players, the __acquirer__ is responsible for transferring the values (which the issuing bank receives from the customer) to the account of your store.
