To develop a __native mobile app__ of your store (either for Android or iOS) and sell through it, __it's important to have the PCI certificate__ in one of your ratings. This is because native apps run in an environment outside of VTEX and it is necessary to ensure information security at all levels of the buying process.

In a purchase made through a native app, the customer data (personal data, payment, delivery, etc.) is sent to VTEX through API. Only then is the order created and the payment processed. VTEX is PCI-certified (read more in detail below) and ensures data security, but the application must also comply with the protocol.


## How to obtain PCI certification?

To get a PCI certificate for your store, you need to consult a PCI QSA (PCI Qualified Security Assessors) company. These companies are qualified to evaluate systems and processes on a case-by-case basis. A good example is [Cipher](https://cipher.com/br/avaliacao-consultoria-pci-qsa-asv/).

You can answer all your questions about the certification process on the official __[PCI Security Standards Council website](https://pt.pcisecuritystandards.org/index.php)__.


## Alternatives

We do not recommend that you invest in a PCI certification. Instead, you should make use of VTEX certification to avoid extra costs. But there are other opportunities for an application in your store, you can work with the alternatives.

### Hybrid mobile app

In the case of __apps running on Webview__ on Android and iOS systems, we understand that __there is no need for your own certificate__. This is because both front-end and back-end run within VTEX: your client is already browsing and entering data in a secure, certified environment.

### Progressive Web Apps

With the __PWA__ solution, __you also don't need your own PCI certificate__. The [PWA](/tutorial/como-transformar-o-site-da-minha-loja-em-um-pwa?locale=en) is a web application that is created on the mobile device using cached website data. That is, all that the end user sees is information obtained and executed in your store, which is in a safe and certified environment.


## VTEX Certification

VTEX is certified by the __PCI DSS__ (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), which ensures that the data entered on the platform is secure. Our infrastructure, front-end, and back-end development processes undergo annual assessments for the renewal of the PCI DSS Certificate.
