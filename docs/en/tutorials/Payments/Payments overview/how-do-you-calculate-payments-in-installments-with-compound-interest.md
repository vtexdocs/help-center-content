There are two possible configurations for collecting installment payments with compound interest:
- Collection at the **beginning of the period**;
- Collection at the **end of the period**.

## Beginning of the period

Collection at the beginning of the period is calculated as follows:

1. i = Interest rate
2. n = Number of installments
3. PV = Present Value (total amount of the purchase without interest)
4. Installment = ![juros-inicio-periodo](https://images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/3JkoK4GMLYAWIwUcAC8W2G/59d18849c4ee9e59ff37cb09ac661c89/juros-inicio-periodo.png)

## End of the period

Collection at the end of the period is calculated as follows:

1. i = Interest rate
2. n = Number of installments
3. PV = Present Value (total amount of the purchase without interest)
4. Cash Flow Multiplier =![cash-flow](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/2xvT7uQ8ccGoCUw8ouOEoK/936546d7e46be7b9ce984c531daf5e8b/cash-flow.png)
5. Installment = `PV x Cash Flow Multiplier`

## Examples
