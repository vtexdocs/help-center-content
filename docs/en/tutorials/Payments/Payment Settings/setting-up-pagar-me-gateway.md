Pagar.me is a [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that offers several solutions for processing payments in your store.

To set up Pagar.me, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Pagar.me__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. In the __External Service Url__ field, configure the external URL that will be associated with `/pvt/payments?an={AccountName}`.
5. Fill in the registration fields with the data provided by Pagar.me (fields __appKey__ and __appToken__).
6. In __Implements Installments Service__, you must choose whether you want to use external installment services or the one that is configured on the portal. If you choose _yes_, the system will use the URL configured in the __Installments Service Url__ field.
7. In __External Cancellation Service__, you must define whether or not to use an external cancellation service. If you choose _yes_, the system will use the URL configured in the __External Service Url__ field.
8. In the __Installments Service Url__ field, configure the external URL that will be associated with `/options`.
9. In __SoftDescriptor__, indicate the text that will appear to identify the transactions made in your store.
10. In __Captura de seguran√ßa antecipada__ ("Early security capture"), choose how long you want the capture to take after the transaction approval and the anti-fraud analysis. You can also disable this function.
11. In __Use Anti-Fraud__, inform if you wish to use an anti-fraud system.
12. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Pagar.me will be configured in your store. Thus, while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided that the payment method is compatible with the Pagar.me).
