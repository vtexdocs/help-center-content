In VTEX, you can integrate your store with Braspag gateway. With that connector, you may carry sales with credit card and bank slip, for example. To find out how to set Braspag up, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Braspag gateway affiliation

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
3. Click the __Braspag__ connector.
4. In the __Id do Merchant__ field, fill in the data provided by Braspag.
5. In each __Brand__ field *(Visa, Mastercard, Diners etc.)*, choose the acquirer who will process the payment with the cards of these brands.
6. In __Boleto Bancário__ (Bank Slip), choose the acquirer who will make the communication with the ticket issuing bank.
7. In the __Instruções no boleto ao Caixa__ field, enter the necessary guidelines for the bank employee who will receive the ticket payment.
