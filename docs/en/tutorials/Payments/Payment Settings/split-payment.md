>⚠️ This is a marketplace payment solution.

To guarantee that our [marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-marketplace--680lLJTnmEAmekcC0MIea8) clients automatically divide the payment between all [sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-seller--5FkLvhZ3Few4CWWIuYOK2w), set a commission based on a fixed percentage, and remain operating in accordance with current regulations, VTEX offers the __Split Payment__.

Below are two examples of split payment application scenarios where a consumer adds products from different sellers to the same cart:

1. When the marketplace is responsible for processing payment for the purchase, VTEX automatically divides this payment so that each beneficiary receives their share directly into their own bank account, thus carrying out the [Payout Split](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/split-payment--6k5JidhYRUxileNolY2VLx#payout-split).
2. When the cart involves sellers who are responsible for processing their own payment method (without depending on the marketplace), VTEX creates different payment transactions for the Marketplace and the sellers, performing the [Transaction Split](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/split-payment--6k5JidhYRUxileNolY2VLx#transaction-split).

>⚠️ The distribution of purchase amounts is always carried out in accordance with pre-defined commission percentage agreements between the marketplace and sellers.

Check below for more details about each of the split payment models:

## Payout Split

This split payment model enables marketplace clients to gain more control and visibility over payouts and commissions. And grants more control over the payment flow as VTEX holds the seller's payment until the order is invoiced.

Marketplaces can indicate how the purchase amount should be split and which percentage is reserved for the marketplace itself defining automatic commissions per total cost of products, freight, or SKU's category for each seller with the transaction being processed only by the marketplace payment provider who will be responsible for paying out each seller.

For example, a shopper adds two products to the same shopping cart. One of them will be fulfilled by the marketplace itself and the other one belongs to a seller called Seller A. However, only one transaction is generated, meaning that the end consumer will only see one line in the credit card statement. 

__The payment is distributed as follows:__

![Payout Split](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2Pqz4t4XkfA1WGZOi1VCX0/1694e5c9947473a360e50010881fee70/PAYOUT.png)

As you can see, our Gateway calculates and distributes payouts for each recipient when the order is invoiced and sends that info to the payment provider. The distribution is done according to the amount destined to each merchant in the order and the commissions taken by the marketplace.

![Receivables](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1rJ1dG3TMX9UqjPr5H4GMR/1b024e71291ab003f9b6379d0ffcecca/RECEBIVEIS.png)

Our __Payout Split__ solution has some limitations that are important to consider:

- __Combined Payment Methods__: it does not support when one of them does not support Split. Example: gift card + credit card (gift card does not support Split).  Currently, it is only possible to have the split payment when the combined methods are two credit cards due to a checkout limitation.
- __Change Order__: it does not work with changes in values or items after the order is placed. Orders containing splits can be partially refunded, but not cancelled.
- __VTEX Subscriptions__: it does not support marketplace orders.
- __Sellers ID__: CNPJ is the primary  key to make the split, so the recipients (marketplaces or sellers) need to be legal entities.
- __Same CNPJ__: since the CNPJ is the primary key to make the Split, it is not possible for two or more recipients/sales participants with the same CNPJ to be seen as different "entities".
- __Parties Involved__: it does not allow to Split the payment with recipients who are not selling products in the cart. For example: to split the freight directly to the carrier.
- __Nominal Fees__: it does not allow nominal fees. Currently, it is only possible to apply percentage commissions on products and/or freight.
- __Assigning transactions to the provider__: today it is only possible to assign a preferred affiliation at the gateway to process Split using commercial conditions for the SKUs that are sold by the Seller. However, there are limitations:
    - If the seller and the marketplace have the same SKU, the cart will always go to the Split payment method.
    - The list of SKUs has to be constantly updated.

- __Transaction interest__: it is not possible to select who will receive the interest information (marketplace or seller). All transactions in which the customer made interest payments are automatically sent to the marketplace.

## Transaction Split

In the __Transaction Split__, the marketplace is not a "centralizer" of the payouts. Right after the shopper completes the purchase, our checkout system creates one or multiple transactions (one per seller). 

The payment is not always processed by the marketplace payment provider, but by each merchant’s payment provider (each seller’s payment provider is responsible for processing their portion of the transaction).

Meaning that the marketplace has less control over the payment flow. Unlike the other model, VTEX does not hold payment until the order is invoiced, each share will be automatically sent to the respective participant right after the checkout

For example, a shopper adds two products to the same shopping cart. One of them will be fulfilled by the marketplace itself and the other one belongs to a seller called __Seller A__.

![Transaction Split](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3uiBeqiyYlaneMksnW4G0v/8a47d871bdc64ccec3d812b4449b053e/TRANSACTION.png)

In the __Transaction Split__, the marketplace has no need to make any configuration. The seller is the one that needs to configure their own payment method in the affiliation with a given marketplace.

![Report](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3YX8MmCPvAWyJpZ7tFAHt4/7276a3b6c1ff1cf1d4d6fe5ccd7bdba9/REPORT.png)

The transaction split has a few __limitations__ that must be taken into account:

- __Setting Commissions__: in this model marketplaces cannot automatically receive commissions, as the transaction is not processed by its payment provider. Marketplaces will have to manually collect their commission from sellers, potentially increasing marketplace default risk.
- __Payment Methods__: it is incompatible with boleto (Brazil), Pix (Brazil), Payment Apps and credit cards with 3DS2 or any payment method with authentication.
- __Intercessing Payment Methods__: Intercesses payment methods, meaning that it only allows payments with credit card, cash and promissory if all involved merchants accept them.
- __Fraud Mitigation__: every merchant will have to analyse fraud risk on their own. If one of the merchants' fraud providers deny a transaction, all other transactions will also be declined.
- __For non-VTEX sellers__: if the seller is a non-VTEX seller it is necessary that it uses a Gateway account, which is a type of account that allows the seller to configure payment methods.
- __Parties Involved__: it does not allow to Split the payment with recipients who are not selling products in the cart. For example: to split the freight directly to the carrier.
- __VTEX Subscriptions__: it does not support marketplace orders.

## Combining Split Models

When Transaction Split and Payout Split are combined, the Transaction Split will prevail. That is, for sellers who choose to use their payment methods, their portion of the transaction will be processed at their own gateway and the values of the other sales participants will continue to be processed by the marketplace.
