At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Mollie payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through credit card, promissories and Mollie.

To configure Mollie affiliation, follow the steps below:

<ui>1. Access the __Admin__ VTEX.</ui>

<ui>2. Click on __Payments__.</ui>

<ui>3. Then, click on __Settings__.</ui>

<ui>4. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the __+__ button.</ui>

<ui>5. Click on the __Mollie__ connector.</ui>

<ui>6. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with data provided by Mollie.</ui>

<ui>7. In the __Payment capture__ field, select one of the available options:</ui>

 - __Use Behavior Recommended By The Payment Processor__: capture is not automatic; it is scheduled according to the period specified by the acquirer. The acquirer indicates whether the payment has been authorized and can determine or recommend a number of days for the capture upon payment authorization.   
 - __Automatic Capture Immediately After Payment Authorization__: capture is automatically performed right after payment authorization, even if the transaction includes an anti-fraud analysis.
 - __Automatic Capture Immediately After Anti-fraud Analysis__:  Capture is automatically performed right after payment authorization and anti-fraud analysis. If you select this behavior and do not have anti-fraud analysis, the system will perform the payment capture as in __Automatic Capture Immediately After Payment Authorization__.  
 - __Deactivated: Not Automatically Captured__: capture takes place only when the order is invoiced. If you select this behavior, it is important to pay attention to the invoicing time, as invoicing can exceed the capture time agreed with the payment provider and lead to the cancellation of the transaction.

<ui>8.Click on __Save__.</ui>

To set up payment conditions, access [Configure special payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento). For the credit card option, select the __vtex-integration-mollie-v0__ affiliation.

After following the indicated steps, Mollie connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
