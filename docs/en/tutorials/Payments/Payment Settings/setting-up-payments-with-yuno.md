2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Yuno__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__ and __Account ID__ fields with data provided by your account Yuno.
5. In __Auto Capture__, select whether the payment capture will be automatic after authorization.
6. In __Delay To Capture (in days) Default 1 day, max 7 days__, fill in the period (in days) in which the payment capture must wait to be carried out. The default value is 1 day and the maximum is 7 days.
7. In __Delay To Cancel (in hours) Default 6 hours__, fill in the period (in hours), in which the transaction can be canceled after authorization. The default value is 6 hours.
8. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the `Install app` button and follow the installation instructions.
9. Click on `Save`.
