2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Epago__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __App key__ and __App token__ fields with data provided by your account ePago.
5. If you wish to modify the identification name to be displayed for the ePago provider on the VTEX Admin screen, enter the information in the __Name__ field in __Basic Information__.
6. In __Payment Control__, select whether you want to activate the provider in a test environment by clicking __Enable test mode__.
7. Click `Save`.

## Setting up the payment condition
