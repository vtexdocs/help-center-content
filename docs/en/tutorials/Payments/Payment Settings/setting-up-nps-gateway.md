>❗ This payment integration can no longer be configured on the platform due to the [legacy provider removal process](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/legacy-payment-connectors-will-be-discontinued-in-2024--4R5YIjUu1IWkiOHzXtQU14) and the article will soon be removed from the Help Center. Check with your provider for more information about developing the new payment integration and the steps required for migrating settings in your store.

Ingenico ePayments (NPS) is a [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) with a strong presence in Latin America which allows your store to accept various payment conditions.

To set up NPS, follow the steps below:

3. Click the __NPS__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Id de la Tienda__ field ("Store ID") with the data provided by NPS.
5. In __Pais__ ("Country"), choose the country where your store operates.
6. In the __Moneda de transaccion__ field ("Currency of transaction"), define which currency will be used in your store transactions.
7. In __Llave secreta__ ("Secret key"), enter your password registered in NPS.
