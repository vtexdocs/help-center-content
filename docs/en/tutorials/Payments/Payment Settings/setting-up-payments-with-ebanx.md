2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Ebanx__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Click on __Authorize__. You will be redirected to the Ebanx environment.
5. In the Ebanx environment, enter your Ebanx account login and password. Follow the indicated instructions to complete the Ebanx account linking with VTEX.
6. After returning to __Admin VTEX__, click on `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Ebanx, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).
