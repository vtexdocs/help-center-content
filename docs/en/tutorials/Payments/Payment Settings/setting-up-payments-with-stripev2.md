On VTEX, you can integrate with the payment provider StripeV2. Through this provider, your store can offer several payment methods, such as Visa, American Express, Diners, Elo, Hipercard, Mastercard, BankInvoice, Stripe, Google Pay, Apple Pay, OXXO, Discover, Affirm, Klarna, ZIP, BLIK, Ideal, SPEI, Multibanco, Afterpay, Bancontact, EPS, FPX, Giropay, and P24.

## Operation modes

The StripeV2 provider can process payment transactions in VTEX stores in two different ways:

- __VTEX Checkout Experience__: Can be used for credit cards, debit cards, and payment methods developed with the [Payment Provider Framework (PPF)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-integration-payment-provider-framework). This option is recommended if you want to configure other payment gateways for different card brands or perform transactions using the native VTEX Checkout.

- __VTEX with Stripe Payment Element Experience__: Payment app based on the [Stripeâ€™s Optimized Checkout Suite (OCS)](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-is-stripe-s-optimized-checkout-suite-(ocs)?locale=en-US). This option is recommended if you plan to use Stripe exclusively to process all card brands or if you want access to [Stripe Link](https://stripe.com/payments/link), a solution that offers one-click access to multiple payment methods.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  The <b>VTEX with Stripe Payment Element Experience</b> uses the <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements">Stripe Payment Elements</a> Checkout, providing access to current and future payment methods supported by Stripe. In this option, payment methods must be configured directly in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods">Stripe Dashboard</a>.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
