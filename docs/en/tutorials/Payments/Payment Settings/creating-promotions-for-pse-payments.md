[PSE (Pagos Seguros en Línea)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/setting-up-payments-with-pse--7dRChubn7TqdEyWrHQEQp6) is a payment method available in VTEX stores for transactions in Colombia. If you already use PSE in your store and want to offer a special payment condition to customers based on the type of bank selected, you can create a regular promotion for PSE.

To configure promotions by bank using PSE, you need to:

- [Identify the bank code](#identifying-the-bank-code)
