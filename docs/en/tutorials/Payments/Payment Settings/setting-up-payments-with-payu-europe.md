At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the PayU Europe payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through credit, debit cards and promissories.

To configure PayU Europe affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. Access the __Admin__ VTEX.
2. Click on __Payments__.
3. Then, click on __Settings__.
4. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the __+__ button.
5. Click on the __PayU-Europe__ connector.
6. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__, __Public API Key__, __Soft descriptor__ and __Type of refund__ fields with data provided by PayU Europe.
7. In the __Early capture__ field, choose how long you want the capture to take place (after transaction approval and anti-fraud review). You can also disable the function.
8. In __Have an anti-fraud deal with this affiliation?__, select whether your store will use an anti-fraud deal with this connector.
9. Click on __Save__.

To set up payment conditions, access [Configure special payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento).

After following the indicated steps, PayU Europe connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
