VTEX has a native gateway with [PCI Security Standards Council certification](/en/faq/what-is-the-pci-ssc). This means that it follows the highest standards of data security, ensuring more protection for transactions in your store.

There are three different connectors: with __VTEXB2W__ configured, your store in B2W's marketplace will process payments made with bank slips and the major credit card brands. Just follow the steps below.

## Setting VTEX B2W gateway affiliation

3. On the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
