At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the PayU India payment provider. With this provider, your store can make sales through credit cards and Notes Payable.

To configure PayU India, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __PayuIndia__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__, __Public API Key__, __Soft descriptor__ and __Type of refund__ fields with data provided by PayU India.
5. In the __Early capture__ field, choose how long you want the capture to take place (after transaction approval and anti-fraud review). You can also disable the function.
6. In __Have an anti-fraud deal with this affiliation?__, select whether your store will use an anti-fraud deal with this connector.
7. Click `Save`.

To set up payment conditions, access [Configure special payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento).

After following the indicated steps, PayU India may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
