At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Pine Labs payment provider. With this provider, your store can make sales through credit cards, bank invoice and Notes Payable.

To configure Pine Labs, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Pinelabs connector__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with data provided by your account Pine Labs.
5. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the `Install app` button and follow the installation instructions.
6. Click `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Pine Labs, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, Pine Labs may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
