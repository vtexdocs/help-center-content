The notification area of the payments module is responsible for the registration of the email that will receive notifications about actions that need to be taken by the shopkeeper in relation to payments made in their store.

### When does the notification happen?

The email registered in this section is notified whenever a problem occurs in the payment process, such as:

- Automatic reimbursement not completed (you will need to carry out the process manually)
- Incorrect settlement

### How to register an email to be notified

To register an email, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Access the __Notifications__ tab.
3. Enter the desired e-mail or select to use your own.
4. Click `Save`.
