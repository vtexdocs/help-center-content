4. In __Provider Authorization__, fill in the __App key__ and __App token__ fields with data provided by your account Conekta.
5. If you wish to modify the identification name to be displayed for the Conekta provider on the VTEX Admin screen, enter the information in the __Name__ field in __Basic Information__.
6. In __Payment Control__, select whether you want to activate the provider in a test environment by clicking __Enable test mode__.

8. In __Indicar número de MSI (3, 6, 9, 12)__, enter the number of months that customers can split the payment (interest-free).
