In this article, we will cover the different scenarios related to payments in[ VTEX marketplaces](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#ser-um-marketplace-vtex) and the configurations involved.

For VTEX clients in Brazil, both the seller and the marketplace can process payments, depending on the commercial conditions negotiated between them and the payment provider.

Learn more about the payment split and the settings required to configure the seller or the marketplace as the payment processor.

## Payment split

Orders placed in a marketplace may contain items from multiple sellers, which are paid for in a unified checkout experience at the marketplace's storefront. VTEX offers the Payment split solution so that the total amount of the order is automatically divided according to the commissions configured when adding a seller.

If the seller is the payment processor, they must operate under the conditions determined in our [Transaction split](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/split-payment#transaction-split). Similarly, if the VTEX marketplace is the payment processor, it must follow the [Payout split](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/split-payment#payout-split) flow or perform its transactions outside the VTEX environment.

>ℹ️ VTEX clients in Brazil can use both transaction splits and payout splits. However, VTEX clients in other countries must only use transaction splits. Please note that some countries impose restrictions on transfers between sellers and marketplaces. Get in touch with your country's financial authorities to learn more about these restrictions before building your payment architecture.

Use the OMS reports to calculate commissions when setting the amounts for transfers outside the VTEX environment. In Brazil, transfers in external environments, without the participation of platforms such as VTEX, can only be performed by financial institutions.

## Payment settings

See below for the necessary configurations to create commissions for sellers and to configure a seller or a marketplace as the payment processor.

>ℹ️ If your integration with external sellers or VTEX sellers is done via API, please refer to the article <a href = "https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/external-seller-processing-payments">External seller processing payment</a>.

### Configuring commissions for sellers
