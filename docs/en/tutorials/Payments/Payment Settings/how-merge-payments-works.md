__Merge Payments is the evolution of the Payment Split.__ With it, you may increase the methods and conditions of payment for orders made in your store.

With this feature, part of the payment is in the marketplace and the another part is passed directly to the sellers.

If the marketplace has different methods and payment conditions than the sellers, the methods and conditions of the marketplace - including coupons - that don't exist in the sellers, along with the methods and conditions offered by each seller, will be displayed in Checkout.

## For this to happen, we have to consider two scenarios:

__When the marketplace wants to include their payment methods__

You must enable the flag __I want to include my payment method__, at the time of the seller's registration in Admin.

1. Enter the __Catalog__ module.
2. Hover your mouse over the __MarketPlace__ tab.
3. Click __Sellers__.
4. Register a __New Seller__ or __Edit/View__ an existing Seller.
5. Activate the flag __I want to include my payment method__.
6. To finish, click __Save__.

__When the seller wants to include their methods of payment__

You must activate the __Use my payment method__ flag at the time of the affiliate registration in the Admin.

1. Enter the __OMS__ module.
2. Click the __Settings__ icon.
3. Then, in the __Affiliates__.
4. Register a __New affiliate__ or click on an existing one.
5. Activate the __Use my payment method__ flag.
6. To finish, click __Save__.

After that, you can make the payment merge available in Checkout.

Using this feature, your store doesn't lose previously abandoned sales due to lack of payment methods options and your clients gain more possibilities in the moment of purchase.
