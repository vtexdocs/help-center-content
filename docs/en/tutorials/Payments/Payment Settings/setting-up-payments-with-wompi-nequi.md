At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Wompi-Nequi payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through Nequi (colombian payment system).

To configure Wompi-Nequi affiliation, follow the steps below:

2. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the `+` button.
3. Click on the __Wompi-Nequi__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__, __Llave publica (produccion) - Wompi__, __Llave privada (produccion) - Wompi__, __Llave publica (prueba) - Wompi__ and __Llave publica (prueba) - Wompi__ fields with data provided by Wompi-Nequi.
5. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the __Install app__ button and follow the installation instructions.
6. Click on `Save`.

## Setting up payment condition

2. In the __Payment Conditions__ tab, click on the `+` button.
3. Click the __Wompi-Nequi__ payment method.
4. Activate the condition in the __Status__ field.
