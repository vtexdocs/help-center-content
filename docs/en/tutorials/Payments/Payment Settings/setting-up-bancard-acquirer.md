Bancard, one of Paraguay's leading [acquirers](/en/tutorial/what-is-an-acquirer), can be set up to process payments in your store.

To enable Bancard, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Bancard gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __Bancard__ connector.
5. In the __Application Key__ field, enter the application key provided by Bancard.
7. In __Application Token__, fill in the field with the token provided by Bancard.
8. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Bancard will be configured in your store. So when you enter a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with Bancard). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
