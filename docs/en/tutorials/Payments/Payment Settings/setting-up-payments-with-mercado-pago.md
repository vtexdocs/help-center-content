In addition to a sub-acquirer that processes transactions carried out with various payment conditions, Mercado Pago also offers a [digital wallet](/en/faq/what-is-an-e-wallet) service. To enable this payment condition, you must first configure one of the supported gateway affiliations:

- MercadoPago
- [MercadoPagoV1](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-o-subadquirente-mercadopagov1#)
- [MercadoPagoV2](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-o-subadquirente-mercadopagov2)

Below are the settings for __Mercado Pago__ connector.
