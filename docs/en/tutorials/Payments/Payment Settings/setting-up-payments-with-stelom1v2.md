4. In __Provider Authorization__, fill in the __App Key__ and __App token__ fields with data provided by SteloM1V2.
5. If you wish to modify the identification name to be displayed for the SteloM1V2 provider on the VTEX Admin screen, enter the information in the __Name__ field in __Basic Information__.
6. Click `Save`.
