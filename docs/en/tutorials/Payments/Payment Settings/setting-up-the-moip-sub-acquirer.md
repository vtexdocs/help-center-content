Moip is a [sub-acquirer](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-sub-acquirer) that provides a single integration to connect your store with all parties involved in the payment flow. as well as protection against fraud and a [transparent checkout solution](/en/tutorial/what-is-transparent-checkout) with no redirects.

>⚠️ The information in this article are just configuration references for merchants who are already using the Moip sub-acquirer. For new affiliations, we recommend using the sub-acquirer [MoipV2](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-o-subadquirente-moipv2--4BipUcTxQ7cq2BiYzUDmEH).

To configure Moip in your store, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Moip gateway affiliation

1. Access the VTEX __Admin__.
2. In the __Payments__ module, click on __Settings__.
3. In __Gateway affiliations__, click on the green “__+__” button.
4. Select the __Moip__ connector.
5. Fill in the fields with the following information:

    - __Token and Key__: enter the information provided by Moip.
    - __Receive payments__: select whether payments will be received in installments or in full.
    - __Early capture__: define how long after transaction approval and anti-fraud analysis the payment should be captured. You can also disable this option if you prefer.
    - In the field __Do you have an anti-fraud agreement with this affiliation?__, select Yes if you have the anti-fraud solution and want to use it.

  6. Click on <b>Save</b>

>⚠️ Moip does not process transactions if there are products costing "US$0" in the shopping cart.  For example, suppose you create a gift wrap product as an [attachment](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-um-anexo--aGICk0RVbqKg6GYmQcWUm?&utm_source=autocomplete). In this case, this item’s price will be US$0, preventing the payment from being processed.

## Setting up the payment condition

Once you have completed the steps above, Moip will be ready to be used in your store. It will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field — provided that the payment method is compatible with Moip — when creating a payment condition.
