Developed by Alignet, Pay-me is a payments solution that has several features. On VTEX platform, it acts exclusively as a [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) to process the Alignet __payment condition__ (which also has a connector with the same name aimed at this function).

To enable Alignet payments using Pay-me gateway, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Pay-me gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __Payme__ connector.
5. Fill in the registration fields with the data provided by Alignet (fields _Código de adquirente_, _Código de Comercio_, _Password_, _PrivateKey Comercio_ and _PublicKey Alignet_).
6. In the __Currency__ field, select one of the currencies that can be processed by the gateway.
7. In __Language__ , choose between Spanish and English.
8. Click __Save__.

## Setting up Alignet payment condition
1. Within the Payments module __Settings__, click on the tab __Payment Conditions__.
2. Click the __+__ button.
3. Click the payment method __Alignet__.
4. Click the __Status__ button to enable this payment condition.
5. If your store has an anti-fraud set up, you can activate it by checking the box __Use Anti-Fraud__.
6. If you wish, you can also add a [special payment condition](/en/tutorial/special-conditions).
8. Click __Save__.

After following the steps indicated above, Alignet will appear at your store checkout as a payment option. After clicking __Finish Purchase__, your client will be redirected to authentication in the Alignet environment. You may also enable this payment condition by using the [Alignet connector](/en/tutorial/setting-up-payments-with-alignet).
