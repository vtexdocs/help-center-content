First, go to the **Explore** screen and click on the **Masterpass** extension.

Then, you will have access to the extension details page, where the following information will be displayed:

- **Description**: explains what the extension does;
- **Screenshots**: show how the extension changes your store or your admin;
- **Specs**: technical specifications of the extension, showing, for example, its current version;
- **Setup**: shows the steps required to install the extension. 

To install the Masterpass, just click on the green button on the right side of the extension icon.

## Permissions

The installation button will lead you to the permissions screen, where you will be able to view all data and locations to which the extension intends to have access.

Once you accept the permissions, the extension will be installed.

## Preview

A message informing that the installation was successful will be displayed.  

The Extension Store will also make available a Masterpass preview environment where you can test the functioning of the extension. 

This environment works as a draft.  Changes made will not affect the production of your store.

## Publication

To move the Masterpass to the production environment (where your customers will effectively use it), you must publish the change made.

To do this, just click on the **Publicar** button on the top bar.
