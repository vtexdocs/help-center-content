Then, you will have access to the extension details page, where the following information will be displayed:

- **Description**: explains what the extension does;
- **Screenshots**: show how the extension changes your store or your admin;
- **Specs**: technical specifications of the extension, showing, for example, its current version;
- **Setup**: shows the steps required to install the extension. 

To install the Masterpass, just click on the green button on the right side of the extension icon.

## Permissions

The installation button will lead you to the permissions screen, where you will be able to view all data and locations to which the extension intends to have access.

## Preview

A message informing that the installation was successful will be displayed.  

The Extension Store will also make available a Masterpass preview environment where you can test the functioning of the extension. 

This environment works as a draft.  Changes made will not affect the production of your store.

## Publication

To move the Masterpass to the production environment (where your customers will effectively use it), you must publish the change made.

To do this, just click on the **Publicar** button on the top bar.
