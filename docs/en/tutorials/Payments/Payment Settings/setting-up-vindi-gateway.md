2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Vindi__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with the data provided by Vindi.
5. Click `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Vindi, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).
