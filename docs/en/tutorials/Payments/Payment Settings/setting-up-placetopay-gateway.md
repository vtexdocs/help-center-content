PlaceToPay is a gateway that offers transparent solutions for both large and small stores. Among its differentials is the easy integration with the various systems that integrate the payment stream.

To set PlaceToPay, follow the steps below:

## Setting up PlaceToPay gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __PlaceToPay__ connector.
5. Fill in the registration fields with the data provided by PlaceToPay (fields _API Login_ and _API Key_).
6. In the __Authorization Formo__ field , choose whether you want the payments to go through a pre-authorization or not.
7. In __Moeda__ ("Currency"), set the currency in which the transaction will take place.
8. In __Language__ , choose a language.
9. In __Shopkeeper email__ , select whether or not you want the system to send you an email every time a purchase is made.
10. In __Customer email__ , select whether or not you want the system to send an email to your customer when they make a purchase.
11. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, PlaceToPay will be configured in your store. So while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided that the payment method is compatible with PlaceToPay).
