>❗ This payment integration can no longer be configured on the platform due to the [legacy provider removal process](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/legacy-payment-connectors-will-be-discontinued-in-2024--4R5YIjUu1IWkiOHzXtQU14) and the article will soon be removed from the Help Center. Check with your provider for more information about developing the new payment integration and the steps required for migrating settings in your store.

With VTEX, you can set up [PayZen gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) in your store. Easily integrated, it follows the security standards defined by [Payments](/en/faq/what-is-the-pci-ssc).

To set PayZen up, follow the steps below:

## Setting up PayZen gateway affiliation
1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
3. Click the __PayZen__ connector.
4. Fill in the _Id da Loja_ ("Store ID") and _Certificado_ ("Certificate") fields with the data provided by PayZen.
5. In __Moeda da transação__ ("Currency"), fill in the code [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) for the currency that will be used for payments.
6. In __Registered bank invoice__, choose whether to use registered or unregistered bank tickets.
7. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated, PayZen will be configured in your store. So when you enter a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with PayZen). To learn how to set up payment conditions, [visit this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
