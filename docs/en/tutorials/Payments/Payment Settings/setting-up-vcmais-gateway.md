On the VTEX platform, you may set up VC+ [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) to receive payments through Notes Payable.

To set VC+ up, follow the steps below:

## Setting up VC+ gateway affiliation
1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
3. Click the __vcmais__ connector.
4. In the __Application Key__ field, enter the application key provided by VC+.
5. In __Application Token__, fill in the field with the token provided by VC+.
6. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the indicated steps, VC+ will be configured in your store. So while you're registering the promissory payment method, you'll see VC+ available in the __Process with affiliation__ field. To learn how to set up custom payments (such as promissory payments), visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-a-customized-payment).
