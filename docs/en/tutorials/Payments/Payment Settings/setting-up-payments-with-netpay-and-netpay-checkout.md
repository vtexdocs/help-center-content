At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the NetPay payment provider. With this provider, your store can make sales through bank invoice, credit cards and redirect.

To configure NetPay, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __NetPay__ or __NetPayCheckout__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__ and __Numero del comercio__ fields with data provided by NetPay.
5. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the `Install app` button and follow the installation instructions.
6. Click `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by NetPay, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, NetPay may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
