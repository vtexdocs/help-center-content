At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Authorize.Net payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through a credit card.

To configure Authorize.Net affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. Access the __Admin__ VTEX.
2. Click on __Payments__.
3. Then, click on __Settings__.
4. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the __+__ button.
5. Click on the __AuthorizeDotNet__ connector.
6. Fill in the __API Login ID__ and __Transaction Key__ fields with data provided by Authorize.Net.
7. In the __Early capture__ field, if desired, choose how many hours the payment will be captured (before the automatic capture performed by VTEX). For more information, access [Automatic Capture](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-tempo-maximo-para-captura--7dwcaxrcgcFJUk7umqPBw2#automatic-capture). 
8. Click on __Save__.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Authorize.Net, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/condicoes-de-pagamento).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/conditiones-especiales--tutorials_456?&utm_source=autocomplete).

After following the indicated steps, Authorize.Net connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
