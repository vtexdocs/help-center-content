Bcash is a [payment gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that processes payments made with credit cards, tickets and debit to banks Ita√∫, Bradesco, Banco do Brasil and HSBC.

To set up Bcash, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Bcash gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __BCash__ connector.
5. Fill in the registration fields with the data of your account in Bcash (fields _Email_ and _Chave of access_).
6. In __Early security capture__, choose how long you want the capture to take place after the transaction approval and the anti-fraud analysis. You can also disable this function.
7. In __Have an anti-fraud deal with this affiliation?__, inform wether your store has hired Bcash's anti-fraud service.
8. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Bcash will be configured in your store. So while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with Bcash). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
