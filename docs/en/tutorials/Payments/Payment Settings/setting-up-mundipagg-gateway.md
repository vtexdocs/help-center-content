>❗ This payment integration can no longer be configured on the platform due to the [legacy provider removal process](https://help.vtex.com/en/announcements/legacy-payment-connectors-will-be-discontinued-in-2024--4R5YIjUu1IWkiOHzXtQU14) and the article will soon be removed from the Help Center. Check with your provider for more information about developing the new payment integration and the steps required for migrating settings in your store.

Mundipagg is a [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that processes payments made with bank slips, bank transfers and major credit card brands.

To configure Mundipagg, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Mundipagg__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Merchant Key__ field with the key registered in Mundipagg. It consists of 36 characters, including letters, numbers and hyphens.
5. In __Pais__ ("Country"), choose the country of your store.
6. The __Register Url Post Notification at Mundipagg__ field gives an address for you to set up the receiving of notifications about payment statuses. In the link `https://{sellerhost}.vtexpayments.com.br/mundipagg/payment/statusnotification`, replace `{sellerhost}` with your store's account name. Then, send the final URL to Mundipagg to complete the registration.
7. In __Instruções no boleto ao Caixa (Max 350 characters)__ ("Register in the ticket to cashier"), write the instructions that will be printed on the ticket. The text must not exceed 350 characters.
8. In the __Banco do boleto__ ("Bank of ticket"), indicate the bank that will generate the ticket and then validate the reconciliation with Mundipagg.
9. Under __Tipo de Estorno__ ("Type of cash back"), choose between the automatic process or the manual request (in this case, Mundipagg will send you an e-mail notifying you of the pending cash back).
10. In __Dias de expiração do Boleto__ ("Ticket expiration days"), select the number of days to pay before the ticket expires.
11. In __Boleto Registrado__ ("Registered ticket"), inform whether the ticket is registered or not.
12. In __Captura de segurança antecipada__ ("Early security capture"), choose how long you want the capture to take after the transaction approval and the anti-fraud analysis. You can also disable this function.
13. Click __Save__.

>ℹ️ The steps indicated in steps **8**, **9**, **11** and **12** must be completed if you want to offer bank slips as payment conditions in your store.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Mundipagg will be configured in your store. Thus, while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with Mundipagg). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
