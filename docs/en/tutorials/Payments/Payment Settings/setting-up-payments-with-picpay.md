PicPay is a [digital wallet](/en/faq/what-is-an-e-wallet) that allows transfers between users, including merchants. Your customer chooses to pay with it and receives a code to scan using the smartphone application.

To configure PicPay, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __PicPay__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the _Application Key_ and _Application Token_ fields with your __PicPay__ account information.
5. Click `Save`.

## Setting up the payment condition

1. Within Payments __Settings__, click on the __Payment Conditions__ tab.
2. Click the __+__ button.
3. Select __PicPay__ payment method.
4. Click the __Status__ button to enable this payment condition.
5. If there's an anti-fraud set up in your store, you can activate it for this payment condition by checking the __Use Anti-Fraud__ box.
6. Choose whether the payments will be cash or installments.
7. You can also set up [special payment terms](/en/tutorial/special-conditions).
8. Click __Save__.

After following the steps indicated above, PicPay will appear at your store checkout as a payment option. After clicking __Finalize Purchase__, a code will be displayed for your customer to scan with the mobile application and make the payment.
