4. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__, __Clave 1 - Dapp__ and __Clave 2 - Dapp__ fields with data provided by your account Dapp.
5. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the `Install app` button and follow the installation instructions.
6. Click `Save`.
