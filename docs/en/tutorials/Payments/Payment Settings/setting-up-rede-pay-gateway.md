Rede Pay is a [gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that supports payments made with debit and credit cards.

To set it up, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Rede Pay gateway affiliation
1. Enter the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __Rede Pay__ connector.
5. Fill in the registration fields with the data provided by Rede Pay (_API Key_, _Token NIP_ and _Public Token_ fields).
6. In the __Installments__ field , choose the maximum quantity of installments that will be offered to your customers.
7. In __Expiration Time__ , set the number of days for the payment to expire.
8. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, Rede Pay will be configured in your store. So while you're registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with Rede Pay). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
