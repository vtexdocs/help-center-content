[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is a payment platform that offers an integrated system for receiving payments, transfers, donations, and any typical financial transaction in ecommerce and other websites.

>⚠️ You can integrate your store with Stripe via **Application Key** and **Application Token**. To obtain this data, you have to [create your account on the platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register" target="_blank) and then access [Stripe’s documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys" target="_blank) to get your **Public key** and **Secret key**. They are required for the setup in the VTEX environment.

Stripe supports payments in over 40 countries. The list of available countries can be accessed on the [Stripe website](https://stripe.com/enterprise).

To process your payments with Stripe, you must:

1. [Configure the Stripe connector](#configuring-the-stripe-connector)
2. [Configure a payment condition](#configuring-a-payment-condition)

## Configuring the Stripe connector

After installing the Stripe connector, follow the steps below to configure it on the VTEX platform.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __StripeConnector__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the fields below with the following information:
<br>
<ul>
<br>
    	<li><b>App key</b>: Publishable key available in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com">Stripe dashboard</a>.</li>
    	<li><b>App token</b>: Secret Key available in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com">Stripe dashboard</a>.</li>
</ul>
5. Click on __Save__.

After configuration in the VTEX environment, you also need to configure Webhook in your Stripe account.

1. Go to your [Stripe account dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).
2. Click on the __Developers__ button.
3. Click on the __Webhooks__ tab.
4. Click on __Add an endpoint__.
5. In the __Endpoint URL__ field, add your VTEX store’s endpoint URL in the format `https://{account-name}.myvtex.com/_v/notifications` replacing `{account-name}` with your VTEX account name.
6. Click on __+ Select events__.
7. Click on the categories and select the desired events. If you are not sure which events to add, please contact Stripe support and they can help you with this type of configuration.
8. Click on __Add events__.
9. Click on __Add endpoint__.

>ℹ️ If you wish to carry out credit card transactions on Stripe, you must open a ticket on Stripe as follows:
>
> - Request the release of the "raw card data" function, indicating that VTEX and Stripe are payment partners.
>
> - Please attach the VTEX AOC (Attestation of Compliance for Onsite Assessments – Service Providers). To check the latest version of AOC VTEX, access the [VTEX certifications](https://vtex.com/us-en/compliance/certifications) page and download the file available in the PCI section.
>
> The above actions will prevent errors related to the transmission of sensitive data from occurring in the integration between Stripe and VTEX.

## Configuring a payment condition

Once you have completed the steps above, Stripe will be ready to be used in your store. It will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field — provided that the payment method is compatible with Stripe — when creating a payment condition.
