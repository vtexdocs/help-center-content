At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the payment provider Adyen. Through this connector, your store can offer payment transactions in physical stores (VTEX Sales App), using points of sale (POS). For more information access [What is VTEX Sales App?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-getting-started-and-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/7fnnVlG3Kv1Tay9iagc5yf).

>ℹ️ To use the AdyenV3 affiliation in your store through other online sales channels (except VTEX Sales App), visit [Configuring payment with AdyenV3](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-payment-with-adyenv3--7xAz67E2Eg63LWCQNjVdwv).

To use the AdyenV3 affiliation in the VTEX Sales App, you need to:

- [Configure point of sale (POS)](#configuring-point-of-sale-pos)
- [Configure your Adyen environment](#configuring-your-adyen-environment)
- [Configure AdyenV3 Connector (VTEX Sales App) on VTEX](#configuring-adyenv3-connector-vtex-sales-app-on-vtex)
- [Configure payment condition](#configuring-payment-condition)

>⚠️ Settings configured in an environment external to VTEX may be discontinued or modified without prior notice. Please check your Adyen account for the latest information.

## Configuring point of sale (POS)

The first step is to configure your Adyen and VTEX accounts to allow point-of-sale (POS) payment transactions. To perform these settings, access the following documentation:

- [Adyen - Terminal API go-live checklist](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/get-started/go-live-tapi)
- [VTEX - VTEX Sales App Basic settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-getting-started-and-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/7fnnVlG3Kv1Tay9iagc5yf)

## Configuring your Adyen environment

The steps described below are the minimum required settings for configuring the Adyen connector correctly. Client customizations or enabling specific payment methods or platform features have to be done following the [Adyen](https://docs.adyen.com/) documentation.

To enable VTEX access to the Adyen environment, follow the instructions below:

### Getting the Company and Merchant account credentials 

1. Log in to your [Customer Area](https://ca-test.adyen.com/) on Adyen.
2. In the left sidebar, copy and save the information shown above **Company**. This is your Company account.
3. In the list below Company, search for the Merchant Account that will be used (highlighted in white). Copy and save this information.

### Getting the POS Live URL

This information is related to the endpoints used by Adyen's endpoint APIs in a production environment. For more information, visit the [Adyen docs](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/terminal-api#cloud).

### Getting the Live URL prefix

1. In the sidebar, go to **Developers > API URLs**.
2. Click `Copy` in the **Prefix** field, and store the information in a safe place. This prefix controls your endpoint on the Adyen platform.

### Getting the API Key

The steps below assume that the API Key has been previously generated in the Adyen environment. If you need to create them, see the [Adyen](https://docs.adyen.com/) documentation.

1. In the sidebar, click **Developers** and, then, click **API credentials**.
2. Select your API credential.
3. In **Server Settings > Authentication**, select **API key**.

<blockquote><ui>4. Click <b>Generate key</b> and store the generated key in a safe location.</ui>

### Configuring a webhook

You need to configure a webhook to allow Adyen to send payment status updates to your VTEX account. For more information, see the Adyen [Webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) documentation.

Follow the steps below to configure a webhook:

1. In your [Customer Area](https://ca-test.adyen.com/) on Adyen, go to  **Developers > Webhooks**.
2. Click the blue `+ Webhook` button.
3. In the **Standard Webhook** option, click **Add**.
4. In **General > Description**, add a description for the new webhook. Example: "Webhook Adyen Connector Provider v3".
5. In **General > Server configuration > URL**, enter the URL of your VTEX account. Example: https://{{account}}.myvtex.com/_v3/api/webhook/notification.
