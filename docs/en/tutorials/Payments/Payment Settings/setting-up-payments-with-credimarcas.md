At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Credimarcas payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through Notes Payable and Private Labels cards.

To configure Credimarcas provider, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payments > Settings__, or type __Settings__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the `+` button.
3. Click on the __credimarcas__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with data provided by Credimarcas.
5. In the __Payment settlement__ field, select one of the available options:

    - __Use Behavior Recommended By The Payment Processor__: capture is not automatic; it is scheduled according to the period specified by the acquirer. The acquirer indicates whether the payment has been authorized and can determine or recommend a number of days for the capture upon payment authorization.
    - __Immediate: Automatic Settlement After Payment Authorization__: capture is automatically performed right after payment authorization, even if the transaction includes an anti-fraud analysis.
    - __Immediate: Automatic Settlement After Anti-Fraud Analysis__:  Capture is automatically performed right after payment authorization and anti-fraud analysis. If you select this behavior and do not have anti-fraud analysis, the system will perform the payment capture as in __Immediate: Automatic Settlement After Payment Authorization__.
    - __Scheduled: Schedules The Automatic Settlement__: By selecting this option, the field __Scheduled time frame in hours for automatic settlement__ will be displayed, and it must be completed with the period in which the automatic capture will take place. This period must be in accordance with the limits allowed by the payment provider.
    - __Deactivated: Not Automatically Captured__: capture takes place only when the order is invoiced. If you select this behavior, it is important to pay attention to the invoicing time, as invoicing can exceed the capture time agreed with the payment provider and lead to the cancellation of the transaction.
