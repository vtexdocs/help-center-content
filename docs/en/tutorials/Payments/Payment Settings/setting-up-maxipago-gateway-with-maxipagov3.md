MaxiPago! is a [payment gateway](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-payment-gateway) that connects your store to the major acquirers and payment methods in Brazil. To use this gateway in your store, we recommend that you use the MaxiPagoV3 connector, which is the most current integration.

To set up maxiPago! with the MaxiPagoV3 connector, follow the steps below:

## Setting up MaxiPagoV3 gateway affiliation
1. Access the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __MaxiPagoV3__ connector.
5. In the __Application Key__ field, enter the application key provided by maxiPago!.
6. Under __Application Token__, fill in the field with the token provided by maxiPago!.
7. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, MaxiPagoV3 connector will be configured in your store. So when you enter a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with MaxiPagoV3). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
