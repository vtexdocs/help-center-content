6. In __Country__, select the country of your store. Today, MOLPay is only available to __Malaysia__.
7. In the __Currency__ field, choose the currency that will be used in your store transactions. Because it only operates in Malaysia, the only option available today is the __Malaysian ringgit__.

7. You can configure [special payment conditions](/en/tutorial/special-conditions).
8. Click __Save__.

After following the steps indicated above, MOLPay will appear at your store checkout as a payment option for your customers to use.
