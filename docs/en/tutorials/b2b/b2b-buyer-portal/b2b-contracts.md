A contract establishes the commercial conditions between a B2B customer and your store. It centralizes the management of purchase agreements, defining what products buyers can access, which prices apply to them, and which payment methods they can use.

>⚠️ Contracts are only available for B2B Buyer Portal. Authorization from the Commerce Engineer of the account is required for usage.

Contracts are stored in the `CL` [Master Data v1](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tutorials/master-data) data entity. This is the same entity that stores shopper data in B2C scenarios, but for B2B contracts, it follows specifications that enable the B2B Buyer Portal functionality.

## Data

The contract contains the basic information about the B2B buyer, including contact information (email and phone numbers) and corporate information (trade name and corporate document, among others). It also contains commercial condition specifications.

### Commercial conditions

The contract defines the commercial conditions that apply to the B2B buyer. You can configure:

* **Price tables**: Associate one or more [price tables](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tracks/tabelas-de-preco-definicao-de-conceito) to the contract.
* **Product collections**: Select which [product collections](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tracks/collections-concept-definition) the contract has access to, limiting which products buyers can view and purchase.
* **Payment methods**: Specify which payment methods buyers can use for transactions.
* **Credit cards**: Define which credit cards buyers is allowed to use during checkout.

## Contract management

B2B store operators can create, edit and delete contracts through the [B2B Contracts API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/b2b-contracts-api). Each contract is identified by a unique contract ID that is automatically generated by VTEX when the contract is created.

> ⚠️ When creating or updating contracts, you must send each field according to the specifications provided. Otherwise, the Checkout module will not be able to autofill data during the shopping flow.

> ℹ️ Buyer organization members can manage some of their contract information (for example, email and phone number) via the [Organization Account interface]() interface.
