The architecture of a VTEX store allows offering and selling products in different stores, whether they are VTEX stores or not. When selling products from other sellers in your environment, a VTEX store becomes a VTEX marketplace. You can learn more about partners and growth opportunities in the VTEX ecosystem in [Marketplace strategies at VTEX](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402).

The product shipping architecture between VTEX marketplaces and sellers includes an extensive list of clients who are not only able to sell their products on a [VTEX marketplace](/en/tutorial/configurar-marketplace-vtex--7splyp5MqIyt2Iyz5jsNzb), but also on a different sales channel.

By default, the product that will be shipped from the seller must also be in [stock](/en/tutorial/estoque--6oIxvsVDTtGpO7y6zwhGpb) on the marketplace. This way, we maintain the security of the sellerâ€™s business, allowing the stock of a product to be replicated only if it's also in the marketplace stock. Thus, we guarantee that a product will be sold only if the seller has previously authorized it.

The following image is an example in which Seller A sends a product to Marketplace A. Only after Marketplace A has added to its inventory the product sent by Seller A can the item be sent to Marketplace B.

Marketplaces based on this business model have more advantages, as they are able to expand their product assortment in third-party sales channels, generating more sales opportunities.
