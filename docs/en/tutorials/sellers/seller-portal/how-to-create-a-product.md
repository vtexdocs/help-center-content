On the **New product** page, you can create products and their SKUs quickly and simply in Seller Portal. To access it on VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog** > **Products** and click on the `Create product` button.

To create an active product, you need to keep the **Active** <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> option selected in the upper right corner of the page. If you want to create an inactive product, click the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> button and note that the option will change to **Inactive**. You can activate it later via the product edit page or the product list.

The form to add a new product contains the following sections:

You can change information by clicking the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> button in the row of each image, which opens a menu with the following options:

* **Content:** enter the value of the attribute. For example, "spray".

To add more attributes, click on `Add Attribute` and fill in the required fields.

In the Attributes dashboard, you can view the List of Attributes, which is a group of one or more attributes. By default, when you create the first attribute, it is associated with this group. However, if you wish, you can rename this group and add or delete other attribute groups. Here are the possible actions:

* <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> **button:**
  * **Rename:** rename the attribute group.
  * **Delete:** delete the attribute group and all attributes in it.

  1. Fixation time: long

After you have made the desired changes in the attribute dashboard, save the information.

To edit an attribute, select it from the list. To delete an attribute, click the <i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i> icon. If you delete an attribute from a group that only has one listed attribute, the group will also be removed.

## SKU information

Each product must have at least one [SKU](/en/tutorial/what-is-an-sku--1K75s4RXAQyOuGUYKMM68u) added. If your product has no variations and you want to create **only one SKU** associated with it, fill in the information below:

*   **SKU Reference code**: unique reference code created to improve the store's organization. This is not a required field.
*   **EAN/UPC**: unique SKU identification code (barcode), composed of up to 13 numeric characters.
*   **Package dimensions:**
    *   **Weight:** the field to enter the weight of the package, in kilograms. This is a required field.
    *   **Width:** the field to enter the width of the package, in centimeters. This is a required field.
    *   **Height:** the field to enter the height of the package, in centimeters. This is a required field.
    *   **Length:** the field to enter the length of the package, in centimeters. This is a required field.

 If you want to create **more than one SKU** according to your product's variations, click on the `+ Add variations` button.

> ⚠️ Clicking on `+ Add variations` will delete the data you have entered in the **SKU information fields**.

What differentiates one SKU or product variation from another is the many possible combinations of specifications.  For example, you add _a pair of sneakers_ and configure its _color_ specification with the _pink_ and _blue_ options and its _size_ specification with the sizes _7_ and _8_. This product's SKUs will be the combinations of the previous options: _pink sneakers size 7_, _pink sneakers size 8, blue sneakers size 7,_ and _blue sneakers size 8_.

Specifications are prerequisites for distinguishing SKUs, so clicking on the `+ Add variations` button will open a modal window where you can **[create specifications](#creating-specifications)**.

## Creating specifications

To create a product specification, you must fill in the following information:

*   **Specification name**: write the name of the specification you want to create. For example, color and size.
*   **Options:** define the possible options related to this specification. For example, pink. In this field, you must enter the options you want to include and type the option name, press `enter` or click on **Create “option name” +** to proceed and create other options.

If you want to create more specifications, click on the `+ Add specification` button and fill in the new fields.

After configuring the specifications, click on the `Create` button.

The specifications you’ve created and their respective options will be listed in the **[Specifications](#specifications)** section and can be edited later.

By combining these different options, the system automatically generates a list of SKUs and displays it in the **[Variations](#variations)** section.

![variations EN](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/sellers/seller-portal/how-to-create-a-product_4.png)

## Specifications

In this section, you can find the specifications you’ve created and the options associated with them.

You can edit the specification info by clicking on the <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> button on each row.

> ℹ️ Once you have configured product specifications, you cannot delete a specification or add a new one. While editing, you can only add new values to the existing specification.

You can also click on the `+ Add specifications` button to include more specifications.

When you edit, delete, or add specifications on this page, the system automatically updates product variations according to the new configuration.

## Variations

In this section, you can see a list of all product variations (SKUs) automatically generated from the specifications and options you have created.

To fill in the information for each variation, click on the arrow (**>**) or the row of the variation you want to edit. The fields included in the [SKU information](#sku-information) section will be displayed for each variation you have created.

By clicking the arrow (>), you can view and edit the **Variation Name** and other [information corresponding to the variation](#sku-information). By clicking the `Advanced Editing` button, you can access the product variations advanced [editing dashboard](#advanced-editing).

By clicking on the button, you can perform the following actions:

* **Edit:** change the variation information in the **Advanced editing** window.
* **Edit images:** access the image editing dashboard, which opens the actions listed below. After you have made the desired changes, click on `Save`.
  * **Select images:** select images corresponding to the variation. To select an image, just click on it. If you want to select all images at once, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `A`.
  * **Apply to multiple variations:** you can add the selected images to multiple variations. To do so, click on `Apply to multiple variations +` and select the values of the specifications your image relates to. For example, for an image of beige sneakers, you should select the `beige` option from the `color` specification. The image will then apply to all variations whose `color` specification has the value `beige`, regardless of any other specifications you have set. 

![variacoes-EN](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/sellers/seller-portal/how-to-create-a-product_5.gif)

* **Deactivate:** deactivate the SKU.

> ⚠️ If you add specifications after configuring the variations, the system will recalculate all variations and redefine their fields.

## SEO

The way you fill in the fields in this section affects how the product will be ranked in search engines, such as Google.

## Storefront

In this section you can configure whether the product will appear in your store through the following options:

*   **Visibility**
    *   **Show on site:** toggle button to enable or disable the product display on the store. If the product is a giveaway that cannot be purchased, you must disable this option.
    *   **Show when out of stock:** toggle button to enable this function. If this function is enabled, the out-of-stock product will appear in your store with a Notify Me option, in which customers enter their email to be notified when the product is back in stock. If this function is disabled, the out-of-stock product will not be displayed in the store.
