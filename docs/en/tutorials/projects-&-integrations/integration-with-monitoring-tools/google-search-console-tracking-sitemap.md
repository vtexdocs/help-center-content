Sitemap is an XML file that introduces your store’s hierarchical structure into the search mechanisms.

The VTEX Sitemap is generated automatically, not requiring any settings or customizations.

For an improved loading performance of your XML file, we organized a structure that is segmented by Departments, Categories, Brands and Products.

Your store’s Sitemap is available at [http://www.[domain].com/sitemap.xml](blank "http://www.[domain].com/sitemap.xml")

Adding the Sitemap to Search Console

**After checking the ownership of your store in Search Console, you will already be able to add and relate your store’s sitemap.**

**The indexation of your store is not a prerequisite to the inclusion of the sitemap, but a correct inclusion will enable crawlers to have a better understanding of the hierarchy of your pages, and will speed up content indexation.**

Follow the steps below to register your Sitemap:

Go to your store’s Search Console panel: 
[https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps?resource_id=sc-domain%YOURDOMAIN.com&hl=en**]

Add your new sitemap and click on submit. The Search Console will access the XML and verify it.
 
After successfully adding the sitemap to Search Console, the tool will show you a list of all the URLs:![Sitemap URL List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/projects-&-integrations/integration-with-monitoring-tools/google-search-console-tracking-sitemap_2.png)
