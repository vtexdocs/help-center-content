VTEX uses [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) to establish conditions and sales strategies for a sales channel, such as an ecommerce, a marketplace, a physical store, or a B2B store.

Using trade policies, you can determine catalog, price, promotion, payment, inventory, logistics, and audience segmentation settings for sales channels. It is not necessary to [create a different trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criar-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) for each sales channel, as the same trade policy can be used in multiple channels.
