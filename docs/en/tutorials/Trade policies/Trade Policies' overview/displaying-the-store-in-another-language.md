In order to display your website in another language, a [new sales policy](/en/tutorial/configuring-a-marketplace-sales-policy/) must be created and assigned to the intended language through the __Culture Info__ field.

With the sales policy already created, you will need to adjust the front-end of the store to enable changing the language and, consequently, the trade policies. 
To do so, you must define that for each language the URL must include the parameter `?sc=salespolicyid`, changing the __salespolicyid__ value for the sales policy Id that was set up and assigned to the desired language.
