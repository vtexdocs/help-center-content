On VTEX, you can use [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) to group catalog, price, promotion, inventory, shipping logistics, and payment settings for different sales channels. Sales channels include marketplaces, ecommerce websites, physical stores, or B2B stores, for example.  

>❗ By default, new trade policies are applied to all active sellers. If you wish to apply them only to a specific group of sellers, please specify that in the ticket.

## Manage trade policies

The **Trade policies** section of the Admin features a list of all the trade policies added to your store. You can filter the results, search by keyword, and sort your store’s trade policies. The trade policy ID is automatically determined by the system based on the chronological order of creation.

To define the logistics settings applied to this trade policy, you must [create or edit a loading dock](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-register-a-dock--7K3FultD8I2cuuA6iyGEiW), related to the carriers of your choice, by entering the ID of the trade policy on the page for adding/editing loading docks.

To use the same catalog in more than one trade policy, access the
[Associate Product with Trade Policy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#post-/api/catalog/pvt/product/-productId-/salespolicy/-tradepolicyId-) documentation.

## Request a trade policy

To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), contact our Growth Operations team through [VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) by selecting **Commercial** and `Create a trade policy`.

>ℹ️ For the use of additional trade policy to integrate with [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), [certified connectors (partners)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-connector-partner), or other VTEX stores to be exempt from fees, orders must be associated with it.
