On the product details page of the [Shared Products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-produtos-compartilhados--6vUGj2UmOuLzQTK9pj04lu) module, you can view all information about a specific product, including: 

- The *General information* added by the marketplace for that product, such as its ID, photo, brand, category, and description.

For products that have already been imported, you can:
- Edit the product price.  
- Edit the number of items in stock.  
- Activate the product to make it available for sale in the marketplace.  

To see a product’s details, go to Products > Catalog > Shared Products > Imported, and click on the product.
