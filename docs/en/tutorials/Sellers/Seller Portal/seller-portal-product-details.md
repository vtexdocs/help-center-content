On the product details page of the [Shared Products](/en/tutorial/seller-portal-produtos-compartilhados--6vUGj2UmOuLzQTK9pj04lu) module, you can view all information about a specific product, including: 

- The *General information* added by the marketplace for that product, such as its ID, photo, brand, category, and description.  
- The information of the SKUs linked to the product, which means the product's specific variations that differentiate it from other options offered for the same product.  

For products that have already been imported, you can:
- Edit the product price.  
- Edit the number of items in stock.  
- Activate the product to make it available for sale in the marketplace.  

To see a product’s details, go to Products > Catalog > Shared Products > Imported, and click on the product.
