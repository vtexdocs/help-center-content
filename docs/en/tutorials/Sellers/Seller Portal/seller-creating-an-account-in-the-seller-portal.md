The Seller Portal is an edition of the VTEX platform that allows [sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/marketplace-strategies-at-vtex--tutorials_402#selling-on-marketplaces) to connect and sell their products on marketplaces.
In the portal, sellers have access to all the essential features for operating ecommerce in large storefronts, providing increased visibility and sales conversion.

The Seller Portal allows sellers to:

- Connect quickly and seamlessly to a marketplace.
- Activate their catalog in the marketplace to sell immediately.
- Update product inventory and prices.
- Manage shared products that are already in the marketplace catalog.
- Manage and invoice all their orders in the marketplace, as well as process payments.
- Create their shipping strategy.
- Reduce the time-to-revenue of their sales.

## Creating an account in the Seller Portal

The process of creating an account in the Seller Portal begins with an [invitation sent by the marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/marketplace-convite-de-sellers-beta--6rb2FkcslmDueJ689Ulb9A). Once you receive the email invitation, there are two possible ways to create an account, which depend on whether your store is already hosted on VTEX or not. Follow the steps for the option that applies to your context:

- [Creating an account for VTEX sellers](#connecting-the-vtex-account-with-the-marketplace): store hosted on the VTEX platform.    
- [Creating an account for external sellers](#creating-an-account-for-external-sellers): store hosted on another ecommerce platform, or not yet hosted on any platform.
