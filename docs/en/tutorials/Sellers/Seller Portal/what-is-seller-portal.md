One of the main challenges for retailers, distributors and industries that are migrating to a marketplace and dropshipping model is to onboard new sellers and offer the right tools for the partnership to be successful. From integration to catalog synchronization to sending and receiving orders, the process can be slow, complex, and costly. We are developing the new Seller Portal to bring more speed and simplicity to this journey, helping to unlock new sources of revenue for our customers.

The Seller Portal is an edition of the VTEX platform for sellers to connect and sell their products on marketplaces. Now, marketplaces hosted on VTEX can invite and connect with sellers more quickly and seamlessly, expanding their product assortment and customer base. The portal provides sellers with the essential capabilities for the ecommerce operation in large window displays, increasing visibility and sales conversion. 

Through the Seller Portal, sellers are able to:

- Connect quickly and seamlessly to a marketplace.  
- Activate their catalog in the marketplace to start selling immediately.  
- Update inventory and product prices.  
- Manage shared products, which are already in the marketplace catalog.  
- Manage and invoice all their orders in the marketplace, being able to process payments.  
- Build an order shipping strategy.  
- Decrease the "time to revenue" of their sales.  

## What to expect from the Seller Portal in beta?

Here are some details about the launch of the Seller Portal in beta version:  

- Only marketplaces will be able to create and manage product promotions.  
- The catalog architecture adopted will be that of the marketplace, which means that the marketplace is responsible for the categories and subcategories, and sellers must adapt their products to this existing structure.  
- If the payment is processed by the marketplace, commission disbursement and seller payouts are not handled by VTEX.  
- Support for the seller’s experience will be provided by the marketplace operator.    

### What we’re launching now  
- Environment automatically connected to the marketplace.  
- Marketplace’s orders management.   
- Logistic operation management.  
- Shared catalog with marketplace.  

### What’s coming next
- Managing seller’s own assortment of products
