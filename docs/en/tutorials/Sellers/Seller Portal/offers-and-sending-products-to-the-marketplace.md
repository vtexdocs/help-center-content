## What is an offer?

Whenever a product or a variation is created on your Seller Portal, they are automatically sent to the Marketplace. However, it does not mean that this product is ready to be displayed in the marketplace window and sold. You need to set price and stock conditions for it to become available for sale.

Offer is the name we give to a product or a seller variation sent to the marketplace and that had its price and inventory configured. When you set price and inventory conditions, you make your product or variation ready to become an offer.

## What is the difference between an Offer and a Variation? 

Variations are your store items, which are added to your catalog, but are not available yet in the marketplace window. When a product, or variation, is created in your Seller Portal, it is automatically sent to the marketplace. However, it will only be an offer when price and stock conditions are set.

Offers are your store products that had their price and inventory already configured and sent to the marketplace. 

In the illustration we can see a series of offers from a seller in a marketplace window with the product variations.

## How do I send My Products to the marketplace?

To create an offer of your product in the marketplace, you must configure price and inventory conditions.
Follow the instructions below: 

Add your product to the Catalog. 
> Read our article on My products.

Set the price conditions of your product.
> Read our article on the price list.

 Set the inventory conditions of your product.
> Read our article on inventory.

Once the Price and Inventory settings are completed, your product will automatically become a Marketplace Offer. 

## How do I send Shared Products to the marketplace?

In the Catalogue, go to the Shared Products tab. 

Select the product you want to send and click on the `:` icon.

Click on the Set price.                
> You will be directed to the Pricing module to complete the configuration. Check our documentation to learn more. 

Click on Set inventory.                
> You will be directed to the Inventory module to complete the configuration. Check our documentation to learn more. 

Once the Price and Inventory settings are completed, your product will automatically become a Marketplace Offer. 

## How do I know if my product was sent to the Marketplace?

After setting the price and inventory for your product, the offer will be automatically created in the marketplace. 

1. In the Shared Products dashboard, the 'Status' column demonstrates if the 
product is available or not in the marketplace. 
2. Products that are "Active" already have offers created in the marketplace. 
3. Products that are "Inactive" have not yet been sent to the marketplace. To send them, follow the instructions above.
