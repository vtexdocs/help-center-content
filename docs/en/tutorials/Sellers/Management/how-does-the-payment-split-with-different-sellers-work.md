Let's consider a scenario in which a marketplace has different sellers with payment split settings ([use my forms of payment, at the affiliate)](/en/tutorial/configuring-affiliates)).

In this case, the customer may include two products in the shopping cart, being one from each seller, and both products configured a payment split. Which form of payment will be displayed in the shopping cart?

The form of payment displayed will be that that is common between the sellers. In other words, the best scenario for the marketplace is when sellers have the same forms of payment as the marketplace. This ensures that all purchases made on the website are completed, since the sellers will always have forms of payment in common.
