We define as a __seller__ the store responsible for delivering an order. The seller is responsible for the [fulfillment](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/logistica--53udnvI5eBy8DKo8FOjMoP) process, ie it's the store that must comply with the obligation to deliver the product to the customer.

Besides owning the product and being responsible for the distribution logistics, the seller is also responsible for inventory maintenance, handling, and shipping to the carriers.

A __seller__ can sell its catalog in a third-party store, be it VTEX or not; this seller can also sell its products in its own store, so it acts at the same time as a __seller__ and a __marketplace__, which is called a [white label seller](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/definicoes-de-conta-franquia-e-seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa).

In this scenario, the store responsible for the sale acts as a [marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/o-que-e-um-marketplace), completing the sale and receiving the payment from the customer, while the __seller__ ships the order.

The product assortment sent to a __marketplace__ is set when choosing the [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV).

## Seller types

On VTEX, there are two types, the regular seller and the white label seller.

- __Regular seller:__ The seller is visible in the marketplace storefront and can be selected by consumers during their buying experience.  

- __White label seller:__ The seller remains hidden in the consumer's buying experience, being [automatically selected](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/algoritmo-de-selecao-de-sellers-white-label--3MemNQ4pKkWCpMdzI27AHa) by the VTEX platform to ship the order.
