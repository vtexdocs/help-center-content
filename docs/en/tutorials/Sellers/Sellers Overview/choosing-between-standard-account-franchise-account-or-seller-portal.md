The VTEX platform promotes the collaboration between marketplaces and sellers in different scenarios so that you can plan multiple [marketplace strategies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402). The marketplace is the environment where products are sold, and sellers are inventory owners also responsible for delivering orders.

There are three types of accounts on the VTEX platform and each one allows you to act with a different seller profile:

- **Standard account:** It has all the VTEX platform module configurations and acts as a standard seller, known as [VTEX seller](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#being-a-vtex-seller).
- **Franchise account:** It is associated with a standard account, inheriting its catalog. [Franchise accounts](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl) can configure their own logistics, payment and prices, and use the VTEX platform modules partially. This type of seller is called a [white label seller](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa).
- **Seller Portal:** The [Seller Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-primeiros-passos--6w1vBdRH2uuBGmUqgNQjwK) is a feature of the VTEX platform that allows sellers to connect and sell their products on marketplaces of the VTEX ecosystem, regardless of whether the seller already has a VTEX account. The Seller Portal allows partial access to the platform modules, and the seller type can be standard or [white label seller](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa).

>⚠️ The limit for each Seller Portal account is 100 thousand products. For more information, please contact our <a href="https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests">Support.

The table below presents the main use cases for each account type:

| **Seller Portal** | **Standard account** | **Franchise account** |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| The [Seller Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-primeiros-passos--6w1vBdRH2uuBGmUqgNQjwK) is recommended for external sellers that do not have a VTEX account but want to connect to a VTEX marketplace. This feature allows the VTEX marketplace to [share products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-produtos-compartilhados--6vUGj2UmOuLzQTK9pj04lu) with its sellers, reducing friction and simplifying the operation management. Each Seller Portal environment created integrates the seller with a single VTEX marketplace. | The standard account is recommended for stores that prefer to handle all the ecommerce operations, using [unified commerce](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv) strategies. A standard account can act both as a VTEX seller and a VTEX marketplace, connecting to multiple marketplaces and [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex). | A [franchise account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl) is of strategic use for sales growth operations by integrating physical stores. It offers the advantage of inheriting the catalog of a standard account. Franchise accounts are usually used by franchisees and brand representatives. |
