**Indexing history** is the page that monitors the synchronization status of all products in the Catalog sent to Intelligent Search. It provides a broad view of the indexing progress of your store.

![Histórico da Indexação 1 - EN](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/intelligent-search/intelligent-search-overview/indexing-history_1.png)

The **Indexing status** section displays the following information:

* **Average indexing time:** The average time for products to be indexed, from the time the system received the change notification to the in-store update. Indexing time performance is measured by a green (healthy) or red (bad) dot. 
![Historico Indexação 2 - EN](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/intelligent-search/intelligent-search-overview/indexing-history_2.png)
* **Products in store:** Quantity of products with up-to-date information currently displayed in the store.
* **Indexing status share:** The percentage of products in each indexing step. Status breakdown performance is measured by a green (healthy) or red (bad) dot. The steps displayed are:
    * **Updated:** Latest product update has been entered in the store.
    * **Updating:** New product information is being prepared and entered into the store.
    * **Error**: Means that an error occurred during indexing. There was a problem adding the product and it cannot be indexed. If it is a new product, it will not be available in the store.

You can filter the list of indexed products for a custom view. It is important to note that the average indexing time and status breakdown will be recalculated from the products filtered. 

To filter the list of indexed products, click on `Filter` <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/intelligent-search/intelligent-search-overview/indexing-history_9.png" alt="filtros" width="25"/>.
