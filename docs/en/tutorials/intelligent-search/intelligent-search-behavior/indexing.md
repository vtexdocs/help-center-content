Indexing is the syncing process between store and search catalogs. This feature allows you to keep your content up to date with continuous updates of the product index. It also performs data processing to be used in the search.

Initially, it syncs all the products from your VTEX catalog. After that, data changes — such as product name and status — are updated in real time by the search indexer.

In this sync process, the system queues up the information that has been updated to add it to the search catalog. Once all changes have been indexed, they will be available on the website.

The indexing process is safe and has a retry mechanism — if an item is not indexed on the first attempt, the system makes subsequent attempts until it is successfully completed.

Indexing is fundamental to analyze, process, and organize data as best as possible to improve your search results.
