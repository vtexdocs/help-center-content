In the [Manual Editor](/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/2FpbarYzsnbg7aZZn3TGF8) and the [Visual Editor (beta)](/en/tutorial/creating-merchandising-rules-visual-editor-beta--6xteumx9MsDt0uEppbChu3), the merchandising rule conditions follow the `{criterion} {operator} {value}` format. For example, a condition may be `brand is athletic`, in which `brand` corresponds to the criterion, `is` to the operator, and `athletic` to the value.

Learn about the criteria and possible operators for each type of editing in the following tables:

| `{{specification}}` | Any active catalog specification checked as **Filter** appears as a custom criterion, with the same possible values. The name of the criterion is exactly the name of the added specification. For example, if there is an active specification called `Color`, the displayed criterion is `Color`. <br><br> You cannot create rules with specifications that were not checked as **Filter**.

> ⚠️ The `department`, `category`, and `subcategory` criteria only appear as options to be included in Merchandising Rules if all three category levels are previously configured in the **Catalog**.

## Operators

| Name       | Description | Criteria | Example |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `is`       | - If you create a rule in the Manual Editor using `Term` as a criterion, it will return search results with exact words.<br>- In other editing scenarios, it enables other conditions than the current one to also be applied. | - `Term`<br>- All (except for `Term`) | - If you add `black friday` and a customer searches for `black friday`, the merchandising rule is triggered. However, if the customer searches for `black friday promotion`, the rule will not be triggered.<br>- If the condition is brand is `athletic`, even if the customer selects `hotsport`, `sportist`, and `athletic` in the search, the merchandising rule will be triggered. |
| `contains` | When creating a rule in the Manual Editor using `Term` as a criterion, it generates search results that are not limited to exact words. | `Term` | If you add `black friday` and a customer searches for `black friday` or similar expressions such as `black friday promotion`, the merchandising rule will be triggered. |
| `only`     | Limits the filter to the one that you added. | All (except for `Term`) | If the condition is brand is `athletic`, and the customer selects `hotsport` first in the search, even if they select `athletic` later, the merchandising rule will not be triggered. It will only work if the first brand filter selected is `athletic`. |
