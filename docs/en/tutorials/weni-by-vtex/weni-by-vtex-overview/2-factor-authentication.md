Weni Platform allows you to enable two\-factor authentication (2FA) on your account and/or restrict access to your organization to only users who have 2FA enabled. This feature is ideal for those looking to add an extra layer of security to their project.

### 1 \- Enabling Two\-Factor Authentication on Your Account

You can enable two\-factor authentication on your account by clicking on your profile picture in the upper right corner of the screen \> Account, as illustrated below:

On the account settings screen, select the ""Privacy and Security"" option, enable 2FA verification, and save.

For authentication, Weni Platform uses the Microsoft Authenticator app. Download the app, then scan the QR code displayed on the screen with your phoneâ€™s camera (choose the iOS or Android option depending on your phone's operating system). Log out of the platform to validate the authentication.

When you try to log in to Weni Platform again, you'll be asked to follow these steps:

- Open the app and scan the QR code shown on the screen;
- Enter the one\-time code provided by the application;
- Save to complete the authentication configuration.

Great! If you get to this point two\-factor authentication is now enabled for use. Each time you attempt to log in to the platform, you will be prompted to submit the verification code shown in the Microsoft Authenticator application, as illustrated below:
