In the upcoming articles, you'll learn much more about how our platform works. This article provides a glossary of terms that may appear throughout the documentation, serving as a reference if you have any questions.

1. **Channel**: The communication channel through which the user interacts with the platform. Examples: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Web Chat, SMS, etc.
2. **Contact**: The user who interacted with the platform through one of the channels.
3. **Group:** A set of contacts that can be managed manually through a rule, based on the data provided by the contact or a criterion within a flow.
4. **Flow**: A graphical representation of the conversation between the contact and the platform. It outlines where actions are taken, messages are sent, and responses are analyzed in each situation.
5. **Action Cards**: Flow cards responsible for the actions taken by the platform for the contact. Examples: Send a message, add a user to a group, update contact information, etc.
6. **Decision Cards**: Flow cards responsible for branching the flows, based on the created routes.
7. **Decision Rules**: Comparison rules applied within decision cards to determine which route should be selected.
8. **Routes**: Paths chosen in the flow that depend on the results of the decision rules.
9. **Variables**: Parameters used to replace contact and/or organization values in text. Examples: Globals, contact variables, flow results, etc.
10. **Expressions**: Functions to manipulate data, which may or may not use variables. Examples: Character counter, date and time formatter, etc.
11. **Campaigns**: A set of events applied to groups based on time\-based rules. They allow active communication from the platform, meaning the platform can initiate a flow for a contact without the contact messaging first.
12. **Triggers**: A set of events responsible for passively starting platform flows, meaning rules that activate the flows when a contact sends a message through a channel.
13. **Classifiers**: AI platforms designed to classify contact inputs and return valid keywords that the platform will use.
