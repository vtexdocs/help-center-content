**Weni Platform** provides an intuitive experience for creating intelligent chatbots. With it, you can design the entire interaction the bot will have with its users, as well as define the channels through which it will communicate.

### First Steps

#### In your first visit to the platform, you will see a screen like this:

On it, we will have a login button, and a field for free registration.

1. If you already have an account, simply enter your email, your password, and click the "login" button. If you've forgotten your password, just click "forgot password?" and an email will be sent to you to reset your password.
2. If you've never registered on the Weni Platform, click the "Sign up for free" button, and you will be redirected to the following page:

- Put your e-mail
- Create a password

If you received an invitation and are not registered on the platform, select how you would like to sign in, and a new window will open where you will need to fill in the following information:

**After filling in the fields, click "next".**

##### Filling in the Organization and Project details

> **Note:** If your organization already exists and you are being invited to join, fill in the fields with fictional names just to register on the platform. It is not necessary to use the company's real names.

**After filling in the fields, click "next".**

Choose between creating a custom agent or using a template. To start your experience creating a custom agent, simply fill in the following fields:

1. Agent name;
2. Goal;
3. Content (Optional). This content can also be added at a later stage.

> **Note:** Clearly define the main objective of your agent when interacting with customers. For example: "Help customers find products that meet their needs" or "Provide technical support." This will guide conversations in a direct and assertive manner.

> **Note:** By adding a content base, you enable your intelligent agent to respond effectively to users. Easily import essential information by dragging and dropping files, with the text automatically integrated. Additionally, you can add content directly from websites or copy and paste whatever you need into the database.

Templates are pre-built flows with specific purposes, divided into three categories: support, integrations, and sales. When you click on any of the cards related to a template category, a pop-up will appear detailing its general use.

> **Note:** If you choose to use one of the templates, click on the tab and select one from the options we have available.

Click "Finish" to proceed.

Click "Start" and explore all the features available on the Weni Platform. Make the most of it!
