### Getting Started - Creating Your Project

During the registration and login step, you already created your first organization and project. To add a new organization, simply click on "Create Organization" button.

![Create Organization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/weni-by-vtex/weni-by-vtex-overview/create-project_1.png)

Here, you will need to enter the following information:

![Organization Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/weni-by-vtex/weni-by-vtex-overview/create-project_2.png)

1. Organization Name: This will be the name that appears on the home screen.
2. Description: A brief description of your team and activities.
3. Project Name: The name you will assign to your project to differentiate and organize it.
4. Next

After filling in the fields above, click the "Next" button and proceed to the next step to create your project. You can choose between creating a custom agent or using a template. To start by creating an agent, simply fill in the following fields:

![Agent Creation Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/weni-by-vtex/weni-by-vtex-overview/create-project_3.png)

1. Agent Name;
2. Goal;
3. Content (Optional).

> **Note:** Clearly define the main objective of your agent when interacting with customers. For example: "Help customers find products that meet their needs" or "Provide technical support." This will guide conversations in a direct and assertive manner.

> **Note:** By adding a content base, you enable your intelligent agent to respond effectively to users. Easily import essential information by dragging and dropping files, with the text automatically integrated. Additionally, you can add content directly from websites or copy and paste what you need into the database.

**Templates** are pre-built flows with specific purposes, divided into three categories: support, integrations, and sales. When you click on any of the cards related to a template category, a pop-up will appear detailing its general use.

Choose between creating a personalized agent or using a template to complete the final step of your project. DÃ³ris will appear on your screen, indicating that your project was successfully created. See the image:
