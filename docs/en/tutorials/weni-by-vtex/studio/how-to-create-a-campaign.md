**Campaigns** allow scheduling of messages on specific dates and times, ensuring they are sent to contact groups in a precise manner.

The messages are sent following a pre-defined schedule, respecting a determined sequence. These messages can be scheduled based on specific recipient behavior or their current state, ensuring that communication is relevant and timely.

### Creating a Campaign

-  Go to the ""Campaigns"" option in the ""Studio"" module on the side menu

Each campaign can only operate with one group. Therefore, a new campaign is required for each group you wish to interact with.

-    Now, set the event rules by clicking the ""Add Event"" button, and a new window will appear

1. You can choose to send a message or select a flow.

2. If you want to send a message, type it. If you prefer a flow, select which one you want to send.

3. You will have three options. Choose the one that best fits your campaign plan.

4. Then, set the date and time you want the event to start. The following information makes up a cadence:

-    How many minutes, hours, days, or weeks before or after the value of the contact field.

-    The selected contact field.

-    The time the event will start.

5. In ""Delivered"": This can be used for schedules over 24 hours. Here, you can specify whether people receive the message at the exact time of the event or if you want to standardize all messages to be sent together at a specific time of day.
