Messages are all interactions that take place when you send or receive a message using your contacts or application. Similar to your email account, the platform allows you to view all messages, archive them, delete them, etc.

To access this information, enter your project and click the ""**Studio**"" module in the left side menu.

Then select the ""**Messages**"" option from the side menu. You will come across the following information:

**Inbox**: This folder contains all messages received by a flow. Additionally, the messages here are sent by contacts who are not active in the flow.

**Flows**: The files in this folder include messages received by your flows. These messages are sent by contacts who are active in the flows at the time the messages are sent.

**Archived**: The archiving process removes messages from the inbox but keeps them in your account so you can find them later. Messages found in ""Inbox"" or ""Flows"" can be archived here. If you wish to delete a message, move it to the ""Archived"" folder and then delete it. All messages found here can be returned to their original folder.

**Outbox**: This folder contains pending messages. Once the message is sent, it is moved from this folder to ""Sent.""

**Sent**: Contains all messages sent by the organization.

**Calls**: This folder contains all calls made and received on the channel connected to your account. You can see the date, direction, and duration of the call.

**Schedules**: Contains messages scheduled to be sent in the future. Go to this folder to view or edit messages that have not yet been sent.

**Failed**: Contains messages that were not delivered.

To obtain the metric for all messages exchanged, you must sum all categories.
