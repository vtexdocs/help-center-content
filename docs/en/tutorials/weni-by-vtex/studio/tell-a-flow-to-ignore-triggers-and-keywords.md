When a contact sends a message containing a previously defined keyword to initiate a flow, they will automatically be directed to that specific flow. This means that if the contact is in Flow A and sends a message with a keyword that triggers Flow B, they will be removed from Flow A and placed into Flow B. This behavior is useful when you want to allow your contacts to navigate between different flows using keywords.

However, if you prefer to keep contacts in a flow until they complete it or until the flow expires, you can configure the system to ignore keywords while the contact is active in the first flow.

To configure a flow to ignore triggers and keywords while a contact is still participating, simply adjust the settings accordingly.

-    Access the Flows module and click on the flow you want to perform this action.

-  Click on the three-line icon in the upper right corner of the flow editor, and then click on the ""Edit"" option.
