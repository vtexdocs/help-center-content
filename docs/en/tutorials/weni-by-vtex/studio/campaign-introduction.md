### What is a campaign?

A campaign is a set of temporary events designed to impact groups of contacts. To create a campaign, it is necessary to define a contact group and include at least one date and time variable associated with them.

The temporary events that make up a campaign are scheduled triggers designed to activate at specific moments. These triggers can send messages, initiate interaction flows, and even take priority over other activities the contact may be engaged in on the platform.

### Why use a campaign?

Campaigns are an active form of interaction that allows the platform to communicate directly with the contact, without relying solely on their actions.

Need to follow up on a response from your contact? Remind them of an important commitment? Or notify them about order updates? A campaign can be the ideal solution.

In the next articles, we'll explore how to build your campaigns and properly configure events to optimize your interactions.
