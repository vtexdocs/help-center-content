#### Sienge Chatbot Template

This is a chatbot designed to handle the issuance of duplicate invoices in PDF format, PDF statements, outstanding balances, and external collections through channels such as WhatsApp. Weni provides digital solutions for automating conscious, open, and accessible communication. This chatbot is a template project developed by Weni using the Sienge Platform.

For full automation functionality, an API user must be created with permissions to access the following resources:
  * Invoice generation (duplicate)
  * Generation of the client’s current outstanding balance
  * Accounts receivable entries
  * Client statements by email
  * Clients
  * Webhook management
  * Payment notification history
  * Sales contracts
  * Client’s current outstanding balance (Total)
  * Cost center
