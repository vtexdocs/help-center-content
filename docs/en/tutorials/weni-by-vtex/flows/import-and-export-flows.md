There are many reasons for wanting to import and export flows, from wanting to pass on a solution to a friend that we created on the platform to creating a template to disseminate within our community. Here, we'll explain a little more about how this process works.

### **Exporting**

There are two ways to access the flow export page.
  1. **First Path: Via flow editor**

To access the export page through the flow editor, simply go to the options menu and click the ""Export Definition"" button.

Or also through the Flow module

You can learn a little more about the [Flow Editor ](/l/en/flows-category/flow-editor-tools)and its tools by clicking on the link.

  1. **Second Path: Via general organization settings**

To access the export page through the organization's general settings, just go to the options menu and click the ""Export"" button.

You can learn more about the Organization General Settings by clicking the [link](/l/en/generalsettings/general-organization-s-settings).

Once on the export page, it will display all the flows and campaigns of that organization, grouped by usage, meaning all flows in the same group interact with each other.
If you export only one flow from a group, you may experience issues with its functionality.

To export the flows you want, just select the ones you are interested in and then press the export button at the bottom of the page, it will generate a `.json` file that you can use in the next step, the import.

### Import

To access the flow import page, simply go to the options menu and click the ""Import"" button in the organization's general settings.

After that, on the import page, select the .json file created on the export page and press the ""Import"" button.

That done, just wait a while and your flows will be properly imported into that organization.
