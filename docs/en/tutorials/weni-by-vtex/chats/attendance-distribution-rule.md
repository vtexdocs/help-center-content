### Support Distribution Rule

The current rules for automatic support distribution are:

- Equal and automatic distribution among agents until the limit of simultaneous support sessions is reached.
- When the number of simultaneous support sessions is exceeded, a support queue is created, and agents can manually pick up sessions as they finish their current ones.
- An agent can manually pick up a session even if they are in Offline status.
- An agent can manually pick up a session, even if they are at the limit of simultaneous support sessions.

Weni Chats currently does not allow for the selection of different distribution
and routing rules for human agents.
