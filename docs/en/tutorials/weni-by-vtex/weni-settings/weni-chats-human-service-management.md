### **How to Add Users to the Weni Platform Organization**

To add or remove new users, such as agents, first add the user to the Weni platform. Enter your organization on the Weni platform and click on the ""manage members"" icon, where you can input the names and emails to be added or removed.

Click the **manage members** button in the **Weni platform organization > Enter the email > Select the type of permission** and click **add** in the Weni platform organization.

### Adding Agents to Your Project

To add users who will be part of the human support team, they must be added to the project.

In your Organization, where the projects are listed, click on the indicated location in the specific project:

The process is the same as adding users to the Organization:

1 - Enter the email

2 - Choose the human support permission

3 - Click the add button

4 - Wait for confirmation

If the user will only handle human support, add them only to the project without needing to add them to the organization.

To learn more about permissions, [read this article](https://ilhasoft.helpdocs.io/l/pt/atendimento-humano/weni-chats-conhecendo-o-m-dulo-de-chat-demo).

After assigning the correct permission to the user, the chat module will be available, and they will be a support agent. Now, simply add them to the queue, they will manage.

* Department Name;
* Support Managers (who will view the support history, agent activities, and dashboard);
* Additional options for the department;
* Definition of working hours (the time during which support requests can be opened if the user asks);
* Number of simultaneous support sessions.

After configuring the department, set up the queues.

### How to Add Support Queues in Weni Chats

Every department requires at least one queue to be configured in order to function. So, you must set it up when creating the department. When creating your queue, provide a name for the queue and add one or more agents:

After configuring the department and queue, it's time to create your support tags.

### How to Add a Support Tag

Support tags are selected when closing a support session and are used to filter support histories and dashboards through these tags. Tags can be related to the topic discussed during the session, but it's up to you to decide how best to use them. Remember, when closing a support session, at least one tag is required.

To create a tag, **choose the name > Click Add > Click Save**.

Now, your human support is set up. The next step is to use an ""open ticket"" card in your flow to direct users to human support.
