### Configuring Human Support in the Chats Module

Like other modules on the Weni Platform, **Chats** is located within a project, so the user configuring it must be an administrator or moderator of that project.

For an agent to use Chats, they must be assigned to a **department** (a group for support). Each department includes at least one manager, one queue, and one agent.

The **support manager** can make changes to the department they manage, such as setting business hours, adding or removing agents, creating new queues, and adding or removing tags.

All of this management is done within the project under **Settings > Chats**.

### Sector

In the department, you can set the operating hours for human support, define the limit of simultaneous chats per agent, and add tags. These tags allow agents to classify chats by topic at the end of each interaction, making future searches and reporting easier.

### Queue

A department must have at least one queue. Queues are used to subdivide a department if you want a department with more than one group of agents. If this subdivision isn’t necessary, simply create a single queue.

An example of using queues can be seen in a **Technical Support** department. For this department, it may be helpful to have queues like **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**, where the bot filters and directs the contact to the appropriate queue based on their needs.

If the department doesn’t require subdivision, a single queue is sufficient.

If an agent is assigned to more than one queue, whether in the same or different departments, Chats will route interactions to the agent in order of arrival.

### TAGs

Tags are used to classify the characteristics of a support interaction, allowing chats to be searched and filtered based on these tags. When closing a chat, the agent will use tags to categorize the conversation according to its topic and other relevant characteristics.
