The practice of opt-out refers to the process by which a user can cancel or stop receiving communications from a company or service. In the context of the WhatsApp Business API, for example, opt-out allows customers to choose not to receive further messages from the company, whether for marketing, service updates, or other notifications.

This practice involves providing clear and accessible methods for users to easily stop communication whenever they wish. Opt-out is typically done through keywords sent by the user themselves (like ""STOP,"" ""CANCEL,"" ""UNSUBSCRIBE"") or through buttons or clickable links that remove the contact from the sending list.

**Key Features of the Opt-Out Practice:**

- User Control: The customer has the power to choose when to stop receiving communications.
- Easy to Use: It should be simple and quick for the user to request to unsubscribe.
- Immediate: Companies must ensure that the cancellation is processed without delay.
- Transparent: From the beginning of the interactions, companies need to clearly inform customers how they can opt out of receiving messages.

The opt-out practice is essential to ensure respect for user privacy and preferences, promoting a transparent and reliable communication experience.
**The reasons that might lead a customer to request an opt-out can vary, such as:**

- Disinterest in the content being sent;
- Resolution of the issue the customer had;
- Dissatisfaction with the provided material;
- Registration done without the user's consent.

If the customer loses interest and the company does not remove their messages from the sending list, it can lead to even greater frustration.

This can result in the company's image being tarnished in the eyes of that customer.

Therefore, if they need new solutions or services from the institution in the future, they may not feel comfortable, which could be enough to prevent new business deals from being closed.

**Improving Quality Rating**

To avoid customer opt-outs, you can improve the quality rating of your account.

To improve quality, follow these steps:

- Check if you or someone in your company added a template in the last seven days. This can help identify the template causing an issue.
- Ensure that your notifications comply with our policies.
- Evaluate whether users have opted in to receive recent template topics. For example, if customers agreed to receive only purchase receipts and you use the API for account updates, they may respond negatively because they did not consent to receive that specific communication.
