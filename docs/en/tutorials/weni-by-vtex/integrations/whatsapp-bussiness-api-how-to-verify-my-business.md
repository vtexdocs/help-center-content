**Business Verification** is one of the essential steps to ensure your business is secure and registered with Meta/WhatsApp.

During the verification process, Meta may request documents such as the certificate of incorporation or business license. Additionally, they will verify whether you have authorized access to the business or website domain.

While not all businesses need verification on Facebook, verification may be required to access certain features or display business information to users. For example:

WhatsApp Business: When creating a WhatsApp Business account, business verification will be required.Weni, as an official Meta Business Partner (BPS), enables the business verification button for your company after the number integration. (It’s important to remember that Business Verification is the document verification process, not related to the Official Account Badge).

### **Step 2**

### **Step 3**

Follow Meta’s instructions carefully, read the requirements thoroughly, and enter the information that matches your company documentation/tax ID (CNPJ) or as requested by Meta.

At this stage, the official documents required for business validation will be requested. The accepted official documents are listed here.

**Important**:

- The company information must match the documents exactly;
- Check that the company data suggested by Meta is up-to-date;
- The phone number provided must be available to receive official calls, and this should be the number registered in the CNPJ;
- If you choose the email option, it’s important to use a personal corporate email like **name@company.com**;
- If using the Meta TAG method, follow the instructions carefully.

Failure to comply with these requirements will prevent the verification code from being sent to the company.

Now, just wait for the review, and your company will receive verification approval, which typically takes around 2 business days. In case of rejection, identify the issues and try again.
