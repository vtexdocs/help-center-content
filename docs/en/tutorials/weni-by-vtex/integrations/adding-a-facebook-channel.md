**Facebook has updated its integration policies**, so now you can easily connect a Facebook page to create a Messenger channel in just a few moments.

### Adding a Page

1. In your project, go to **Apps > Discovery**

4. When you click **Connect**, a Facebook login window will appear. Log in with the account that manages the Facebook page.

If you need to log into the platform, you will be asked to give permissions to allow. You should allow all to complete the process. Then, you will be directed back to the previous step.

That's it! You will be automatically directed to the page of your new channel, where you can view your channel's record.

Now, you can create a trigger that references a contact when a new conversation is initiated on Messenger.
