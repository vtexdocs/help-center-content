Instagram has already reached the milestone of 1\.4 billion active users, with more than 500 million browsing assiduously every day, seeking not only interaction, but looking for services and products.

Now, imagine if your institution is not present, active and efficient on this channel? This is no longer a mere social network to share photos and videos of the routine, but rather a showcase of doing business and important partnerships.

And now you can raise the level and potential of your service by creating a channel that integrates your Instagram to Weni Platform.

This creates more engagement and interaction with your followers and potential customers and partners, increasing the chances of closing new projects while reducing operational costs with service.
