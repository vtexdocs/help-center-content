After that, you will see a short description of the channel. The only requirement to connect Viber there is an **Authorization token** (called **App token** by the Viber team).

##### **Now letâ€™s see how to obtain this App token.**

The main process resides in approving a Viber's public account and gathering the App token.

### Creating a Viber account

Install Viber's mobile app and go through the registration process via a mobile phone number exclusively for the project. With your valid account, access Viber's admin panel and link it to a Public account.

You will receive a **verification token** on the mobile phone, confirm it too.

It will take a few seconds to process and a new window will pop-up with the token needed.

##### **Submit the channel**

Now go back to RapidPro, paste the token and hit Submit.

### Edit Welcome message

The Viber channel was created, but to have it published and available for all your public, some steps are required by the Viber support team. The first step required is to **provide a Welcome message**. To add one, go to your **Workspace settings** and open the **Viber Channel setting**s.

After that, click on the **menu icon** and then in the **Edit** option.

Once you click on Edit, a new window will appear for you to add an **Alert email** and **Welcome Message**. Save the changes after that.
