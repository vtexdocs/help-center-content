Now it's much simpler to add a WhatsApp channel to your company's organization on the Weni Platform and connect with your customers in just a few clicks. This is the Weni Express Integration mode.

WhatsApp is the largest messaging app in the world and a favorite among users. Integrating this channel on the Weni Platform allows you to connect your company's business number and create intelligent flows to serve your customers.

There are a few prerequisites for adding a WhatsApp number via the Express Integration method:

1. You must be the administrator of your company’s Business Manager account with Meta;
2. The number should not be installed on another app or associated with any WhatsApp account (business or personal). If it is, you will need to delete the number from the app before starting the process. See how to delete it here.
3. The number must be enabled by the carrier to receive a call or SMS, with the SIM card inserted in a phone ready to receive the verification code that will be sent during the channel integration process.

#### **Now that these prerequisites are met, it's time to start the integration!**

Within the project where the integration will take place, go to the **Applications** module, and in the **Discovery** tab, you will find the WhatsApp integration card. Click on the **\+** symbol to add the integration.

Enter your Facebook login credentials to proceed with the connection. Remember, you must be the administrator of your company’s Business Manager with Meta/Facebook.

However, if you're already logged into the Facebook account that will be used, the step shown in the image below will appear. Simply click on **Continue**.

Then, just follow the steps to link your account.

To begin, after logging into your Facebook account, simply click **""Get Started""** on the screen, and you will be redirected to the next page to continue the process.

Accept the permissions, as they are necessary for Weni Platform to access your WhatsApp Business account, enabling you to use our integrations. But don’t worry! No data will be shared, and the entire process is very secure!

Starting step 2, you will create your WhatsApp Business profile. To do this, fill in the name field that will be displayed on your WhatsApp Business profile. If this name is different from your company’s legal name, it must be displayed in some way on your organization’s website. The display name must follow Meta’s guidelines and align with your business, especially if your account has already been previously verified ( [see here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/338047025165344#display-name-guidelines) ).

If your business is already verified with Meta, the next step can only be completed after receiving an email from Meta confirming the acceptance of the display name. Once you receive the email, return to the platform to continue.If your business is not verified, you can proceed immediately!#### **Final step for integration**
