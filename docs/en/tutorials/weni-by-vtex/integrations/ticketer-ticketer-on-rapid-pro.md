- Open a ticket using flows
- Add service agents
- View and manage services
- Close services
- Transfer services
- Contact information

#### **Opening a ticket in a flow**

You can quickly start a ticket at any point in your flow by adding the 'open a ticket with a human agent' action.

1\. Create a card “Open a ticket with a human agent”

2\. Pick a topic or category. To create a new topic or category option, simply type the name in the bar and it will be automatically created.

3\. This is an optional configuration, in case you don't Assign an agent to the ticket, Any agent will be able to pick up the ticket in the “unsigned” ticket box . In case you choose an Agent, all the tickets will be automatically assigned and appear on the “My tickets” box.

*\*See the section below on how to add new agents to your workspace.*

4\. Add any information you want your agents to see while interacting with the contact by referencing any result in the flow using '@results'.

#### **Adding agents**

Now, you should  add agents to handle the ticket. First, go to your workspace settings page by clicking on your name at the top right.

Scroll down to find on the [multi-login](https://help.nyaruka.com/en/article/multi-login-support-adding-editing-removing-multiple-account-roles-df2ay6/) section.

#### **Viewing and handling tickets**

Click the ‘tickets’ tab(1\) in your workspace to view all tickets. The all folder is for all tickets while the unassigned folder is for tickets that are yet to be assigned(2\).

Once you choose a folder, toggle open or closed using the drop-down menu to view resolved or unresolved tickets(3\).

#### **Contact details**

All customed fields for contacts are visible from the contact’s details pane, along with any information entered from the flow. To open the pane, click on the small square icon on the right of the conversation.

#### **Assigning tickets to another agent**

Aside from assigning tickets from the flow, you can always assign tickets directly from the Tickets tab. Right under the details icon, you will see the icon to assign.

#### **Starting a flow after a ticket is closed**

It is essential to follow up with your contacts once an agent has resolved an open ticket. You can start the contact in a flow immediately after closing a ticket. Navigate to the ""Triggers"" tab then scroll down to find Start a flow after a ticket is closed and choose your flow.
