- Open a ticket using flows
- Add service agents
- View and manage services
- Close services
- Transfer services
- Contact information

#### **Opening a ticket in a flow**

You can quickly start a ticket at any point in your flow by adding the 'open a ticket with a human agent' action.

1\. Create a card “Open a ticket with a human agent”

2\. Pick a topic or category. To create a new topic or category option, simply type the name in the bar and it will be automatically created.

3\. This is an optional configuration, in case you don't Assign an agent to the ticket, Any agent will be able to pick up the ticket in the “unsigned” ticket box . In case you choose an Agent, all the tickets will be automatically assigned and appear on the “My tickets” box.

*\*See the section below on how to add new agents to your workspace.*

4\. Add any information you want your agents to see while interacting with the contact by referencing any result in the flow using '@results'.

#### **Adding agents**

Now, you should  add agents to handle the ticket. First, go to your workspace settings page by clicking on your name at the top right.

Scroll down to find on the [multi-login](https://help.nyaruka.com/en/article/multi-login-support-adding-editing-removing-multiple-account-roles-df2ay6/) section.
