Companies that use the WhatsApp Business Platform are charged for 24-hour conversations, with different rates based on the category.

WhatsApp charges per conversation, not per message sent. Conversations consist of the messages exchanged between the company and customers within a 24-hour period. Once the messages sent by the company are delivered to the customers, the conversation is considered initiated.

Company-initiated conversations are divided into three categories: utility, authentication, and marketing. User-initiated conversations are referred to as service conversations.

#### **Company-initiated conversations**

- **Utility**: This is used to facilitate a request, transaction, or update on ongoing transactions, including post-sale notifications and recurring invoice statements.
- **Authentication**: This is used for user authentication with one-time passwords in various stages of the login process. For example, account verification, account recovery, and integrity challenges.
- **Marketing**: This is used for promotions or offers, information updates, or invitations. Conversations that do not fall under the utility or authentication categories will be considered marketing.

#### **User-initiated conversations**

- **Service**: These are conversations initiated by the user, which help customers resolve their questions.

#### **Conversation charges**

Sending multiple templates of the same category in an open conversation will not result in additional charges, and service conversations will only be initiated when there are no open conversation windows. The company can respond to the user with a free-format message during the 24-hour customer service window.

#### **Exceptions**

Free-entry point conversations occur when the customer contacts the company through a call-to-action button in click-to-WhatsApp ads or Facebook Pages. Since the WhatsApp Business user is already being charged for the ad published on social media, they will not be charged for any message templates sent in that conversation within a 72-hour period.

The initiated conversation is free, but the ad is charged.

Remember that: Each WhatsApp Business account (WABA) has 1,000 free user-initiated conversations per month, regardless of the number of phone numbers included. The free conversation limit is reset each month, according to the time zone associated with the WABA.

#### **Conversation duration**

Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last for 24 hours (unless they are free-entry point conversations â€” from click-to-WhatsApp ads or Facebook Pages). After this period, the time will reset, and any message sent will start a new window, being charged according to the category.
