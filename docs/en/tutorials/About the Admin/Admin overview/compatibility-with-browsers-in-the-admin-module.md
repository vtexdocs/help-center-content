VTEX Admin supports all the most popular browsers, as listed below:

- [GoogleÂ Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
- [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)

Support is offered to the two latest versions of these browsers. For example, if the latest version of Google Chrome is 79, we will provide support to this version and to version 78.

So, if your team is using our platform in previous versions &#8211; such as Internet Explorer 8 or 9 -, you must update the browser to a more recent version. If this is not be possible, adopt the strategy to use a second browser, such as [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), to access our systems.

_This policy has been effective as from **March 10, 2014, **being only valid for systems that manage our Admin. Store pages and SmartCheckout checkout pages are still compatible with former browsers, ensuring the closing of purchases._
