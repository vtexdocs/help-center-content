A marketplace is a virtual platform where different sellers offer their products. It is where products are displayed and where orders are placed. Sellers who list their products in a marketplace are also responsible for delivering them to customers. The set of operations and activities performed by the seller, from receiving the order to delivering the product, is called fulfillment.

[VTEX promotes digital collaboration](https://vtex.com/br-pt/marketplace/) in different scenarios. In addition to selling your products on other marketplaces, you can also act as a marketplace and sell products from other sellers on your website. Learn more about the different [marketplace strategies at VTEX](/en/docs/tutorials/marketplace-strategies-at-vtex).

We have grouped all the features related to these operations in the __Marketplace__ menu of your redesigned Admin. 

Learn more about different sections and pages in this menu.

## Sellers

VTEX's architecture allows stores hosted on the VTEX platform to offer products from other stores, whether they are VTEX stores or not. When a VTEX store starts selling products from other sellers, it becomes a [VTEX marketplace](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#atuar-como-marketplace). The _Sellers_ section of your Admin gathers the features to make it happen.

This section includes the following pages, soon to be included in the redesigned Admin:

- Seller Management  
- SKU Binding  
- Received SKUs  
- Categories and Brands  

## Connections 

This section includes the integrations between your store and marketplaces external to VTEX. Here, you can configure integrations with [native connectors](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrado-a-conector-nativo-vtex) and manage the details of sales made on these external channels. 

This section includes the following pages, soon to be included in the redesigned Admin:

## Marketplace Network

[Marketplace Network](/en/tutorial/encontre-marketplaces-e-sellers-no-ecossistema-vtex--2bzC7tXlVgLEEjxo4ixcAM) helps connect marketplaces and sellers operating in the VTEX ecosystem, opening up the possibility of new business and mutual growth for everyone involved. The page works as a catalog of parties interested in partnerships, allowing registration, inquiries, and contact between marketplaces and sellers for signing commercial agreements.
