To be part of VTEX's partner program, your first step should be hiring the __VTEX Partner Suite environment__. In it, you may run tests, check features, or create a demo store for your customers to view.

Stay tuned to the guidelines below, we have listed some important points related to creating your Partner environment:

- In the field __What category best fits your store?__, select the option __Services__.
- In the field __What name do you want for your account?__, choose a name that is closest to the URL of your agency or company.
- __Never__ use your client's name in the field mentioned above. This can cause an ambiguity in the system.
- __Never__ use VTEX name in the field of your account name. We have many internal accounts, so it's important to determine which ones are ours and which are our partners' and clients'.
- Once created, the name given to your account can no longer be changed by you.

## It is also important that you know:

- Partners hire the VTEX environment to run tests, check features or create a demo store.
- Customers hire the VTEX environment to create their own stores.
- The Partner environment is not your customers' online store. As the name implies, it is an environment for testing, validation, and verifying. For this reason, it can not go live.
