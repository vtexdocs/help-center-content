Once the ticket is solved, the support team will email you a link to a [satisfaction survey](/pt/announcements/avalie-o-atendimento-da-vtex-pelo-seu-admin--7rSJLgGbtRw2GhjTJezkJf). This survey allows you to evaluate the service without leaving the VTEX environment and contribute to continuous support improvement.
