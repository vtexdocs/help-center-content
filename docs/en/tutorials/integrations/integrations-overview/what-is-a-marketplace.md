We define as __marketplace__ the store where a __purchase__ is performed. It's the environment where the customer __pays__ for an order.

In a shopping experience, a user browses a website by selecting products to include in their shopping cart. After selecting the desired products, they arrive at the __checkout__ step. At this stage of the purchase journey, the user fills in their personal data and the information about the delivery and then __makes the payment__.

A marketplace can also be understood as a *showcase store*, displaying its own products and also products from other stores (the sellers). Usually, a marketplace is a store with good users traffic. This encourages other stores to display their products in the marketplace for greater conversion. In such scenario, the __marketplace__ is the shop responsible for closing the purchase, and the __seller__ is the store responsible for delivering the order.

> ℹ️ Following this logic, we can conclude that a VTEX store that sells its own products in its own store acts as a marketplace and a seller simultaneously. In this context, payment is made within the store environment (marketplace) and the delivery of the order is a responsibility of that same store (seller).
