The __Marketplaces and Integrations__ page facilitates the connection and communication between marketplaces and sellers within the VTEX ecosystem, enabling new business and mutual growth for all involved. The page works as a catalog of companies interested in partnerships, allowing registration, search, and contact between marketplaces and sellers to sign their commercial agreements.  

Among the marketplaces available, there are VTEX marketplaces and external marketplaces. Learn more about the difference between each terminology displayed in the Integration Type column.  

| **Integration Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|
| **VTEX** | These are the profiles of VTEX clients that chose to make their environment available for sellers to sell products. |
| **External** | Marketplaces that are not VTEX clients and did the integration, whether certified or partner. |  

> ℹ️ Note that **Marketplaces and Integrations** is a tool that fosters contact between potential partners, yet it is not a mandatory step in becoming a VTEX marketplace. If you want to act as a VTEX marketplace, read the [Marketplace strategies at VTEX](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#sendo-seller-vtex).

## Looking for marketplaces  

To access the page, in the VTEX Admin, click __Marketplace > Connections > Marketplaces and Integrations__. On the page, you can see the recommended marketplaces to connect to and the complete list of all available or already connected marketplaces.

The table listing the marketplaces has the following columns:  

| **Column** | **Description** |

| Industry | Indicates in which industry the marketplace operates. |

### __Connecting to a VTEX marketplace__

When sending a message, provide all the information the marketplace needs for connecting to your business. We also suggest anticipating the questions or topics that might arise in a future meeting, for example.
