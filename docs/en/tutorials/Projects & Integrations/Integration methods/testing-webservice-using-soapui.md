SoapUI is a tool that can be used to simulate the connection and execution of methods of a given webservice without having to do this using programming alone.

**Remember!** We recommend that you use version 3.6.1, which doesn't have as many security requirements (these requirements mean you have to type in your password several times).

The step-by-step utilization is as follows: 
1. After installing the tool, access the menu File &gt; New SoapUI Project. 
2. In the window that opens, enter the address referring to your webservice:
  
`http://webservice-{STORENAME}.vtexcommerce.com.br/Service.svc?singleWsdl` 
 
Substitute the value {STORENAME} with the name of your store.

Log in using the data of the webservice desired. After logging in, you will view all the methods to be found in the [Web Service manual](/en/tutorial/manual-of-classes-and-methods-used-on-webservice/)

1. Locate the desired method. e.g.: the ImageInsertUpdate method, which is the method used for adding images;
2. Fill out the fields referring to the method (these fields are the ImageDTO type, references are in the manual);
3. Locate the button **Auth** and repeat the authentication before executing the method;
4. Execute the method.
