The Hook is an extension of the [Feed v3](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/orders-management-feed-v3-setup--5qDml3cQypWDRTgw69s4C1), tailored to robust operations that require more complex integrations. 

Unlike the feed, its operation doesn't require any reactive commits from users. When a call is correctly placed to an address, the system performs an __auto commit__.

Its main functionality is avoiding an unnecessary feed query by a system or user without having new events, notifying the configured endpoint whenever an order status update occurs. The list of possible order statuses can be seen in the article [Order flow in Orders management](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/fluxo-de-pedido/#understanding-the-status).

To learn more about configuring and using Hook, check the [Feed v3 developer guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/feed-v3-1).
