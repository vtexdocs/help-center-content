Some tools may help you to investigate, measure, and increase the performance of your e-commerce. The purpose of this article is to present some of these tools.

### Web Developer Plugin

The Web Developer extension adds various web developer tools to a browser. The extension is available for Chrome, Firefox and Opera, and will run on any platform that these browsers support including Windows, OS X and Linux.

This tool allows the user to quickly enable or disable several page caracteristics, such as Javascript, CSS, Form validations, Image crawaling and several other helpful tools for site performance debugging.

A handy application to help you identify if a problem on your website is related to front-end or back-end.

Do you know the simplest mistake most companies, agencies, and individuals overlook when it comes to reporting monthly numbers?

Have you ever stopped and thought about how many times you visit your clients’ websites in an hour, in a day, in a month? If you aren’t excluding your traffic to your clients’ websites yet, you are about to see how much of an impact you, your agency and/or even your clients’ employees have when it comes down to inflating your numbers. Let’s say a company has 100 employees and, humor me here, all 100 have their company set to their homepage on their laptops.

### In-Page Analytics

The Page Analytics Chrome Extension allows you to see how customers interact with your web pages, including what they click and don’t click. 

Use these insights to optimize your website layout, improve user experience, and increase conversions. When you view a web page for which you have Google Analytics access, you’ll see: Google Analytics metrics: 

- Pageviews.
- Unique Pageviews.
- Avarage time on page.
- Bounce Rate.
- Number of active visitors.

You can use the Google Analytics date comparison and segmentation tools directly in the extension.
