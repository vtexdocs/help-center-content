With your environment created, it&#8217;s time to plan! Planning is essential for the success of the project — putting your store online. For achieve that, you can count with our partners or the Professional Services team at VTEX. [See our project plans and support plans to have us collaborating at any phase of your configuration.](http://help.vtex.com/en/support-plans)

It&#8217;s important to have a timeline for your project — for that reason, use our [standard project timeline](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/using-the-project-task-timeline/) with all of VTEX's basic configurations that must be setup before your store goes live.
