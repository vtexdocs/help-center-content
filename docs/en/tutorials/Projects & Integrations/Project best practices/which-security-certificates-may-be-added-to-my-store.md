Some existing VTEX virtual stores use security seals not provided by VTEX, such as Digicert, RapidSSL, Comodo CA etc. It is not appropriate to display in the footer (or other parts of the site) such certifications without actually having them. Sometimes these stores also wish to use a certificate from Let's Encrypt (the issuer of the SSL digital certificate currently used by VTEX but which does not provide any official seal).

Another fact is that this type of seal is merely informative - it does not perform any action on the website. Therefore, we recommend using the **PCI Certified** seal mentioned above.
