Google Ads settings are defined on Google Tag Manager, which is set up by the storeowner. It is very important to make a Google search in order to perform this task. See below some details about the setup.

### Monitoring of Google Ads Conversions

A tag that will notify the Google Ads account of every conversion generated by campaigns. This tag should be shown only on the purchase completion page, using the “Transaction” rule which you used previously for Analytics.

### Remarketing Adwords:

This tag will place a cookie on the user’s computer, to facilitate retargeting campaigns. The tag must be inserted on every page.

1. Select the “New Tag” option;
2. Define the tag type as “Google Ads Remarketing”;
3. Enter the “Conversion ID” and the “Conversion Label” supplied in the Google Ads account;
4. Associate the rule previously created and used in the analytics tag: the rule is “All Pages";
5. Create a version of the tag and post it.
