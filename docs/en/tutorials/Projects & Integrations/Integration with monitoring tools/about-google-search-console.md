[Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) is a free tool from Google developed to monitor and manage the quality of your store URLs indexed in the search mechanism.

Through a simple and intuitive interface, Search Console makes analytical data available for directing strategic actions for all sectors of your ecommerce website.

Search Console provides easy and free access to the following information:

* Top search terms
* Top URLs viewed
* Total indexed URLs
* Total URLs with error
* Tracking statistics
* Store security issues

The update from [Webmaster Tools](https://developers.google.com/search) to Search Console focused on expanding the profile of users. It was previously adopted only by Webmasters and search optimization professionals.

Search Console is an excellent tool for entrepreneurs to monitor the positioning and reach of their brands; for ecommerce managers to measure the quality of indexed store content; for Webmasters to check the total URLs indexed and their store’s tracking data; for developers to structure content and optimize the store interface for different devices; and for the marketing team to identify content relevance and new opportunities.

See below all information about Google Search Console for VTEX stores.
