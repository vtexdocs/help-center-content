In order to have the access to **Search Console** data, you must check the ownership of your store. After some simple steps, you will have access to data on your store indexation performance on Google.

1. Access the Search Console using a Google account through the URL: [https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ "https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/")![Primeiro passo - Verificação de Propriedade Google Search Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Projects & Integrations/Integration with monitoring tools/how-to-check-the-ownership-of-vtex-store-on-google-search-console_1.jpg)
2. Select the option **Add property** and enter the URL of your store:![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Projects & Integrations/Integration with monitoring tools/how-to-check-the-ownership-of-vtex-store-on-google-search-console_2.jpg)
3. Checking method: the Search Console makes available several methods for checking the ownership of your stores. The method indicated for VTEX stores is the **HTML Tag**, in the option **Alternate methods**.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Projects & Integrations/Integration with monitoring tools/how-to-check-the-ownership-of-vtex-store-on-google-search-console_3.jpg)
4. **HTML Tag** will generate a meta tag that must be entered in the template of your store’s homepage. Copy the tag shown, and enter it on the `<head>` of your store’s template:![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Projects & Integrations/Integration with monitoring tools/how-to-check-the-ownership-of-vtex-store-on-google-search-console_4.jpg)
5. After including the meta tag in the template, wait approximately 10 minutes to check the ownership on the Search Console.
