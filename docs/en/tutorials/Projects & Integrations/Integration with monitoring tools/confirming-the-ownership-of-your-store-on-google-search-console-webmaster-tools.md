There are two ways to confirm the ownership of your website using Google Webmaster Tools.

- [App](#app)
- [Meta tag](#mata-tag)

## App

You can use the [Google Search Console app for VTEX](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-google-search-console/p). Check the [app documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-google-search-console).

## Meta tag

1. Go to your [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) account. If you have not set up a website, click **Add Site** or, if you already have a website, click **Manage Website** > **Verify website**.

2. Use the **HTML Tag** alternative method. This method generates an HTML meta tag that has to be inserted in the _head_ section of the store home page.

3. After inserting the meta tag in your templates, make sure that the meta tag is in your storeâ€™s home page HTML using the browser option **View page source**. Then, click `Verify`.
