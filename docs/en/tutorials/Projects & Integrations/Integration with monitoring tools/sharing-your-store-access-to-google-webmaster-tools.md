For our consultancy and operations teams to do a better job and give you better service, your Google Webmaster Tools account must be shared with the audit team. For this setup, we must initially access the [Google Webmaster Tools](http://www.google.com.br/webmasters/) account.

After accessing your account, you will be directed to the list of your websites; so, just select the website whose access you intend to share by clicking on your website link.

Now, go to the admin panel of our page. There are several options available on the left-side menu, however, to share the access, you must select the gear icon on the top menu, and click on **Site users and owners.**

The list of users already authorized to access the website will be displayed; then, in order to add a new user, just click on the top of the screen on the **Add New User** button.

Then, a pop-up will be displayed requesting information about the e-mail of the user that will be added, and the type of authorization &#8211; full or restricted â€“ that the user will have.
