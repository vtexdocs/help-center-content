**Google Analytics** targets serve to help you find out whether the objectives of your site are being fulfilled. The purpose of this article is to show how to set up a target, known as "Sales Funnel," on SmartCheckout. To know more about the targets, go to the conversion topic in the Help section of Google Analytics. 

Once the sales funnel is set up, you can monitor and analyze the customer's steps until an order is finalized. To set up the sales funnel on SmartCheckout, let us take into account that the purchase process starts on your product screen, continues through the shopping cart and checkout (personal data, delivery and shipping, payment), and reaches the target, which is the order confirmation page.
