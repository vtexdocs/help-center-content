## Sales Policy

The sales policy is an assortment of products, logistics configurations, and pricing that determines the characteristics of a store. A sales policy is a combination of all these key elements that make up a store.

Sales policies can be created to be used in marketplaces.

To configure the product assortment, you will need to [associate the sales policy](/en/product-registration-fields) to the desired products.

To configure logistics, follow the step-by-step described [in this article](/en/tutorial/configuring-logistics-for-a-marketplace).

To learn more, see our tutorial with more details on [how to set up a sales policy for a marketplace](/en/docs/tutorials/configuring-a-marketplace-trade-policy).

## Seller

The seller's registration will only be necessary in __the scenario in which your store acts as a seller's marketplace__.

Each seller must have a __unique identifier__.

To set up a seller, follow the walkthrough described [in this article](/en/tutorial/configuring-the-seller/).

## Affiliate

An affiliate is a specific partner which interacts with your store information. The affiliate can receive product information or enter orders in your store. An affiliate can send or receive data depending on the action that will be taken.

Affiliate registration will only be required in __the scenario where your store acts as a seller of a marketplace__.

Each marketplace must have a __unique affiliate identifier__.

After creating an [affiliate](/en/tutorial/configuring-affiliates/), you must associate a sales policy with it. The sales policy contains the product assortment, logistics and price information that will be sent to the affiliate.

> ℹ️ If the marketplace configuration is made through the [Bridge](/en/tutorial/configuring-a-marketplace-sales-policy/) module, the affiliate will be automatically created in the OMS.
