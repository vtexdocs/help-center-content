VTEX uses [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) to establish conditions and sales strategies for a sales channel, such as an ecommerce, a marketplace, a physical store, or a B2B store.

Using trade policies, you can determine catalog, price, promotion, payment, inventory, logistics, and audience segmentation settings for sales channels. It is not necessary to [create a different trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criar-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) for each sales channel, as the same trade policy can be used in multiple channels.

To request a trade policy for a sales channel outside the VTEX ecosystem, such as a marketplace for which there is no [native connector](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex) for example, follow the flow of [Requesting a trade policy](#request-a-trade-policy)

## Requesting a trade policy 

To request an additional trade policy for operating in the international market, contact our Growth Operations team through *[Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support)* by selecting **Commercial** and `New trade policy`.

## Billing rules

Each VTEX customer has a defined amount in their contract for purchasing additional commercial policies, which incur a fee. Please note that each VTEX account already has a [native commercial policy](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV), which does not fall under these billing rules.  

A monthly fee is charged for each additional trade policy, whether used for integration with certified, partner, external, or VTEX marketplaces.
