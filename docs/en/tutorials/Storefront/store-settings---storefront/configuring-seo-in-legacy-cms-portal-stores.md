SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is one of the most important strategies to better position your site on organic search engine results pages. Configuring tags, metatags, and favicons is part of this set of strategies to optimize site performance.

The title tag helps define the subject of the page for search engines and directly influences whether users click the search results. The description tag gives users an idea of what they can find on the site. The robots meta tag controls the crawling and indexing behavior of search engines.

## Instructions

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to Store settings > Storefront > Settings.
2. Click the **SEO** tab.
3. Complete the fields based on the guidelines below:
  - **Keywords (meta tag keyword):** Define the words that search engines will use to index your store. Use commas to separate words.
  - **Meta tag description:** Provide a brief description of your store. The description should be informative and contain relevant keywords, as it will be shown in search engine results.

       > ℹ️ The field **Category description (meta tag description)** doesn't need to be completed because it has the same function as the previous field **Meta tag description**.

  - **Robots.txt:** Specify how search engines should crawl and index a specific page. The default values are `index, follow`. For additional values compatible with Google, see the [list of valid rules](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag#directives).
4. Click `Save`.
