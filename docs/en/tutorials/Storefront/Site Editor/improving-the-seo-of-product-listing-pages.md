The Product Listing Pages (PLPs) are responsible for presenting all the products available within a specific category, brand, department, or other filters applied.

The PLPs are correlated as each product links back to a category page — Apparel, for example — and the PLPs influence SEO performance.

To improve the SEO performance of PLPs, you must allow web crawlers such as Google to notice this connection between PLPs. This way,  these crawlers will be able to browse different pages and access other products they show.

See the section below on how to improve the SEO performance of PLPs [using the Site Editor](#using-the-site-editor).

<div style="background-color:#FFF3CD; border-left: 2px solid #F0AD4E; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 35px">
  By following these step-by-step instructions, the style of the <i>SHOW MORE</i> and <i>SHOW PREVIOUS</i> buttons may be affected in stores that are already online. If you're building a new store, follow this tutorial before you start styling your store. If your store is already active, don't forget to check, at the end of this tutorial, if the style of the buttons is as expected.
