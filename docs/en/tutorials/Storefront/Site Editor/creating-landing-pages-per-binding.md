Landing pages are a strategic resource to convert accesses into sales for your store.

In the Admin, you can create customized landing pages by [binding](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-binding--4NcN3NJd0IeYccgWCI8O2W), i.e., develop pages with specific content for each store in your VTEX account. For this, check out the instructions below:

1. Access the CMS' **Pages** section.
2. Select the desired binding in which the new landing page should be created using the dropdown menu on the page.
3. Click on the `Create New` button.

4. In the `Page` details section, fill out the fields to define your new landing page's metadata, according to the expected values:

  - `Title` — Page title to be displayed at the top of browser windows and on search engines' result pages. 
- `URL` — Page's URL. Notice that it automatically reflects the page title, but you can still edit it according to your scenario, adding up custom parameters, for example. To build custom URLs and associate them with custom content, you can check out the [Associating a custom page to a content type](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-associating-a-custom-page-to-a-content-type) documentation.
- `Requires authentication` — Check this box if the new landing page should only be accessible to authenticated users. 
- `Description` — Summary of the new web page to be displayed on search engines' result pages. 
- `Keywords` — Topics that define what the page content is about, helping to deliver the latter to the interested users navigating on search engines' result pages.

  >ℹ️ All five fields above directly impact the store accesses and positioning on search engines' result pages. Before filling the page's metadata out, be mindful of SEO best practices.

5. Choose a template from the available ones to be displayed on your new landing page in the `Default` field.
6. If you desire to create a conditional template, click on the `Add conditional template` button and fill out the fields according to the desired conditions. 

  >⚠️ Notice that the condition template will only be displayed when one <i>or</i> all predefined conditions are matched on the interface.

7. Save your changes.
