A store internationalization requires understanding your audience according to their borders. 

Managing content per binding means strategically customizing your store's look according to users' localization to boost access and sales taxes.

Through the VTEX Admin's Storefront, VTEX enables you to do so. Check below the instructions:

1. Access **Storefront > Site Editor**.
2. On the upper-left corner, select in the first drop-down menu the desired binding to which your content changes should be applied. 
3. Select in the second drop-down menu the desired binding's locale to which your content changes should be applied. 

4. Create, update or/and delete content for the predefined binding and locale, and then save your changes.

>⚠️ Whereas editing a block content, you will not be able to change binding and locale data — the fields will be blocked. If you wish to change them, save or discard your changes and return to the Site Editor home page.
