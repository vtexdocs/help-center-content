Storefront is the graphical interface through which visitors interact with a store website. It defines the user experience and the visual identity of the website through graphic components, typography, and color palette. These elements are customizable and can be managed through the Content Management System (CMS).

The storefront also includes VTEX Intelligent Search, a tool that helps customers in their buying journey by delivering search results as soon as they start interacting with the search bar.

These operations are performed in the Storefront menu of your VTEX Admin. 

See below for the different sections and pages in this menu.
