Projects is a feature in the VTEX Headless CMS that simplifies the management of multiple frontend projects, such as mobile apps, websites, and email marketing, from one control panel.

![Projects pages](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5sXlS9M78whzUVdSxJiKpX/9d484d193a357cf0a0ac5e8a3aa16e9a/projects-one-en.gif)

Each project is customized with its own settings, content, and branding according to specific audiences or purposes. 

In this guide, you will learn how to manage each frontend project of your store.

>⚠️ [ FastStore WebOps users](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview): Changes made through the Headless CMS in VTEX Admin, such as creating new content types, adding sections, or updating fields, may not automatically appear in the storefront once you publish them. This is a known issue, and you should contact your development team to implement the necessary workaround. For detailed instructions, refer to the [ WebOps app is not fully integrated with Headless CMS](https://help.vtex.com/known-issues/webops-app-is-not-fully-integrated-with-headless-cms--577fIocKB9BYYCOkN9dZfW) known issue article.

## Before you begin
For the Headless CMS management, make sure the [resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) `See CMS menu on the top-bar`, `Settings*`, and `CMS GraphQL API` are associated with your [user role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc). Otherwise, [create a custom user role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) and add these resources to it or add these resources to an existing user role.

## Overview
To access **Projects**, go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.

## Creating a new project

Create a new project for your store by setting general settings such as **Project ID**. To effectively connect a Headless CMS project with your project's source code, you will also need to set up webhooks and build settings such as *Build Webhook URL* and *Preview URL*. 

A webhook is an HTTP endpoint that enables automated communication between the VTEX Headless CMS and the project's source code. For example, it allows the CMS to notify a FastStore project of content changes or other events, triggering actions like real-time content synchronization.

1. In the **Projects** page, click `Create new`.
2. In the **New project** page, fill in the fields according to the [Project settings](#project-settings) section.
3. After setting each field of the page, click `Create` and a successful message will appear on the screen.

Once you have created a new project, you can create pages for it with all the URL routes and corresponding page templates of your store’s website, such as home, product, and login pages. 

To create a new page, follow the steps in [Managing Pages in the Headless CMS](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-pages--3DO6rBhZ1p3zndnFu5BgRt)

## Project settings
The Project settings allow you to configure your project according to three main categories:

- [General](#general): Edits the project ID, API settings and archives the project.
- [Content-Types](#content-types): Connects the Headless CMS project with your code source through webhooks by setting up the content types and sections. 
- [Build](#build): Initiates and manages website builds. Set a webhook URL for build notifications and an endpoint to preview the page versions.
