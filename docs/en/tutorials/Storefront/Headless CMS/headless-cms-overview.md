The Headless CMS is a content management system designed by VTEX to empower businesses with the flexibility to create and deliver content across various channels, such as websites and mobile apps.

The term *Headless* refers to the separation between the interface that displays content to the user, the frontend, and the system responsible for managing and storing that content, the backend. This approach allows content management to occur independently of the user interface, providing flexibility and scalability. For example, a merchant can update a product page through Headless CMS without affecting the user experience on the website. This simplifies content maintenance and enables the reuse of data.

To access the Headless CMS, log in to the VTEX Admin and navigate to **Storefront > Headless CMS**. 

<div style="background-color:#FCF8F2; border-left: 2px solid #F0AD4E; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">

- [Manage Projects](#managing-projects)
- [Manage pages](#managing-pages)
- [Manage singleton content types](#managing-singleton-content-types)

## Managing Projects

[Projects](/en/tutorial/managing-projects--42IpDFqTVTESH8DCypJMPM) is a feature in Headless CMS that allows you to create and manage multiple frontend projects like mobile apps, websites, and email marketing from a single control panel.

![Projects pages](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5sXlS9M78whzUVdSxJiKpX/9d484d193a357cf0a0ac5e8a3aa16e9a/projects-one-en.gif)

For more information, refer to [Managing Projects](/en/tutorial/managing-projects--42IpDFqTVTESH8DCypJMPM). 

## Managing pages
Within each project, you can also manage all the URL routes and page templates for your store's website, including the home page, product page (PDP), and others. For more information, refer to [Managing Pages in the Headless CMS](/en/tutorial/managing-pages--3DO6rBhZ1p3zndnFu5BgRt).

## Managing Singleton content types
Singleton is a content type that simplifies content management by creating and managing a single page, guaranteeing the existence of only one version of this content type in the Headless CMS. This approach enhances content reliability and simplifies the creation and maintenance of content within a Headless CMS environment.  For more information, refer to [Managing Singleton content types](/en/tutorial/managing-singleton-content-types--VBibMN1BqV2OFmavUFCdo).
