All VTEX IO stores natively have a Progressive Web App (PWA) at their disposal. A PWA is a web app used to natively promote beneficial features to users, such as offline functionalities or a home screen icon.

The PWA can be made available for installation in three distinct moments of users’ browsing experience: during their first visit to your store's website, when adding the first item to the shopping cart, or when completing their first purchase.
To configure the prompt in your store, follow the steps below.

## Configuring a PWA in your store
1. In the VTEXAdmin, access the **Store Settings > StoreFront > Store**.
3. Click on the **PWA tab**.
4. Choose the **Theme color**, **Background color** and upload the **Android and IOS Logo Icon**. 
5. Go to the **Other PWA settings** section and click on the arrow to show other settings.
6. Toggle the **Add to Home Screen** button. In the field **Prompt “Add to Home Screen”**, select when you want the push notification to be triggered.
7. Save changes by clicking on `SAVE`.
