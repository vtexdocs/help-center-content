*Store Settings* are the configurations applied to your store, storefront and how your end customers interact with your ecommerce. We have grouped all settings applied to your store under the __Store Settings__ section on the left navigation menu.

This article is an overview of the settings available for the **Storefront** section. In your VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Storefront**.

The Storefront section includes settings for your storeâ€™s interface with end-customers, like general storefront settings, checkout and store configurations. It is also where Master Data and GraphQL IDE can be accessed. This section includes the following pages:
