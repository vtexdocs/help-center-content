System settings are general configurations related to the store operation. The purpose of this article is to explain how to edit these settings. To access the configuration section, follow the steps below:

1. On the side menu in the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings > Storefront > Store**.
3. Go to the __General__ tab.
4. Fill in the fields described in [General settings fields](#general-settings-fields).
5. Click on `Save`.

## General settings fields

The fields available for editing are:

- **Store name:** The name of the store.
- **Home page title (title tag):** The name that will be displayed in the title of the page.
- **XML text:** XML text of the store.
- **Buy Together max. quantity:** This is the maximum number of promotions of the “Buy Together” type that can be added to the same shopping cart.
- **Show order notes:** Displays a field for your store's customers to send comments, special requests, or remarks in text form during the purchase.

- **Show "Notify me" option when out of stock:** Enables the Notify me feature on the product page.
- **Activate UTMI links - Internal navigation tracking:** Enables the UTMI feature in the store. When this flag is enabled, all store links automatically receive UTMIs internal to store links. Here is an example:

  ```

  To leverage UTMIs in reports, you must create filters and specific views in Google Analytics.
- **Unit of mass:** standard unit of measure for mass used in the store.
- **Unit of length:** standard unit of measure for length used in the store.
