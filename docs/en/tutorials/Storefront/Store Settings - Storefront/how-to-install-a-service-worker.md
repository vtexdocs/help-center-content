Service Worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from the Web, enabling features such as periodic synchronization, push notifications and even running offline.

To create the script, follow the step-by-step instructions below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Storefront > Checkout**, or type **Checkout** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> icon of the desired site.
3. In the `Code` tab, click the `New` buttton.
4. Then click on `File`.
5. Fill in the file name exactly like: `service-worker.js`.
6. Click the `Create` button.
7. Set the feature.
8. Click the `Save` button.

Although the file is in `/files/service-worker.js`, it receives the `Service-Worker-Allowed` header with the value `/`, which allows you to intercept requests from the site root.
