In the **Pages** section you can find all URL routes and corresponding page templates of your store’s website, such as home, product, and login pages. You can also create and associate custom pages to predefined templates and manage pages created directly in the source code of your storefront project. 

<div style="background-color:#cfe2ff; border-left: 2px solid #084298; border-top-left-radius: 2px; border-bottom-left-radius: 2px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 15px">
   If you want to create fully customized pages, please contact your developer partner and refer to our <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-4-configuringtemplates">Configuring templates documentation</a> for more information.
</div>

In Pages, you can also create URL redirects to forward website visitors and search engines from one URL to another. Redirects are helpful when you need to move content to a new URL and remove an old product page.

In the VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Pages** and check out the main tools available in the interface.

| **Tool** | **Description** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| **Default** | Check out the custom pages of your store’s website. Pages are classified into **Default, Product, Product collections, and Not found (404).** |
| **CREATE NEW** | Create a new landing page by choosing its Title, URL, Keywords, and template. **Product, Product collections** and **Not found (404)** pages cannot be created in the Admin, only in the store theme code. |
| **Redirects** | Create redirects to move content to a new URL or remove an outdated page. |
|**Edit** | Modify the title, template, and URL of pages created in **Storefront > Pages**. You can also delete them. For custom pages created in the source code of your storefront project, you can only edit their title and template. |
