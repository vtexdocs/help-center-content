One of the first things you have to do in your web site is to link it to a store. This process is called binding, and it is very simple. All you have to do is follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Storefront > Layout**.
2. Click the __CMS__ folder.
3. Click the __Sites and channels__ folder.
4. Click on the desired Website.![websites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/Storefront/Layout/linking-an-account-name-to-a-website-binding_1.png)
