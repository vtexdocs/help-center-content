The title of a placeholder is what appears in the right corner of the object, as the image below indicates.

![cms-placeholder en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_1.png)

The text that is entered in this field is what will be displayed as a placeholder title on the store's website.

To change the title of a placeholder, just follow the steps below:

1. Click the title.

2. Insert the new title.

3. Click __Rename__.

4. Click the __Save Settings__ button.

Because it is a native VTEX control, __you can not change the placeholder's HTML code__.

For example, the placeholder title is rendered on the site as an `<h2>` tag. You can not change this through the Admin.

Also __you can not set an empty title for a placeholder__. If you want to hide the title on the web site, you need to do this through CSS.
