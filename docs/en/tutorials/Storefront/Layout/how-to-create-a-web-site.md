A [website](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/o-que-e-um-web-site--5sPUdFEv9C02i0MMqqSo0U?&utm_source=autocomplete) consists of a series of folders and files that make up and define the content of the web pages displayed to your store's visitors.

Follow the steps below to create a website or publish your first store.

1. In VTEX Admin, go to **Storefront > Layout**..
2. Click on **CMS > Sites and channels** and select **new website**.

3. Under **Website**, fill in the fields required to create the website. 

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Id do WebSite** (Website ID) | Website identification code. You are not required to create one, because the system automatically generates an ID for your website.
| **Website name** | Enter a name for the website |
| **Parent website** | Website to which your new website will be linked. If you don't want to link your website to another one, leave the field blank. |
| **Mobile website** | Mobile version of the website. If you do not want to create one, leave the field blank. |
| **Tablet website** | Tablet version of the website. If you do not want to create one, leave the field blank. |

4. After making the necessary changes, click `Save Website`. A confirmation message will be displayed, and your new website will be created in the **Sites and channels** directory.
