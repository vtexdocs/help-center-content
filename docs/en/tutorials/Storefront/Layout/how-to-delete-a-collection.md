>⚠️ **Warning:** there are two ways to configure collections, through the CMS or the Collection module. This article is about how to <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-collections-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L">configure collections through the CMS</a>.

## Via Admin
You can not delete a collection altogether via Admin.

The best way to render it inactive is to set dates that do not apply to the validity range.

By default, collections are created with the date of the current day up to 50 years ahead.

__Simply set a past date to ensure the collection will not be activated.__

## Via API

You can delete a collection created in the CMS through the route [Delete Collection](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/catalog-api-collection#catalog-api-delete-collection).
