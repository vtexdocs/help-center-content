Templates are the files that contain the code of the pages of your web site. They are responsible, among other things, for determining how the information will appear on the screen (including the position of the [placeholders](/en/tutorial/what-are-placeholders)).

In VTEX platform, templates are divided into two types:

- __HTML Templates (or page templates)__: they are the ones that structure the HTML code and reference JavaScript and CSS files to be used in the pages of the web site.
- __Shelves Templates__: Define the structure and content of shelves, elements that group products from view criteria, and can be used on more than one page.

This division exists to facilitate the organization of the templates and, consequently, the code of your web site. Imagine you want to change the code on a shelf that appears on several different pages. It's much more practical to edit a single file than to access the templates that contain the codes of each one.

In addition to these two basic types, there is also a subdivision of the __page templates__ which is called __Sub Templates__. Like shelves, they are elements that will appear on most (or all) pages of your web site, such as footers, menus, headers and others. Therefore, they also have their own repository.

And speaking of organization, you will find all templates in **Storefront > Layout > CMS**, gathered in folders according to their type (HTML or Shelves). __Sub Templates__ are in the folder of the same name, which is inside the __HTML Templates__ directory. There, you will be able to create new templates and edit the ones that already exist.
