>⚠️ This tutorial is for stores using Legacy CMS Portal. For other stores, the configuration is made in [Pages](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/paginas-visao-geral--5iBUUJbK5NqG6OxlDrGNzc). Please refer to [Managing URL redirects](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciando-redirecionamentos-de-url--3UJuFrU8imSVWg134mkvJV) for more information.

URL mapping is used to redirect specific URLs to other URLs. This feature is useful when a store already has URLs indexed in search engines and wants to redirect them to more attractive ones without changing the SEO and avoiding indexing errors.

All mapping activities recorded will be executed according to 301 redirects. The 301 redirect, also known as “permanent redirect,” transfers all key data from the original URL (**Page Rank**, **Link Popularity**, etc.) to the new URL.

There are two ways to add and change URL mapping:

- [Manually](#manually)
- [Via spreadsheet](#via-spreadsheet)

## Manually

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Storefront > Layout**
2. Click on the **CMS** folder to open the directory.
3. Click on the **URL Builder** folder.

4. Click on the `Add` button to add a new mapping or the `Update` button to edit an existing one.
5. Fill in the [URL Builder fields](#url-builder-fields).
6. Save by clicking on `Save URL`.

### URL Builder fields

- **Url from:** URL that will be redirected. This URL must not contain the domain. Required field.
- **Url to:** URL to which the navigation will be redirected. This URL must not contain the domain. Required field.
- **Start date:** date and time when the mapping will start to be considered. Required field.
- **Start date:** date and time when the mapping will no longer be considered.
- **Active:** indicates if the mapping option is active or inactive.
