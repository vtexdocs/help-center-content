A __web site__ is made of a structure of folders and files, which will compose the pages and define the content that will be displayed to those who access their addresses. 

In VTEX, the web site represents your store and is formed by some basic elements:

- [Templates](/en/tutorial/what-are-templates): code repositories that structure HTML and reference JavaScript and CSS files to be used on pages.
- [Layouts](/en/tutorial/what-are-layouts): elements that are linked to the templates and that configure the placeholders that will be displayed on the page.
- [Placeholders](/en/tutorial/what-are-placeholders): predefined elements that you can use to display content files on the pages of your web site.
- Files: external information that can be read by your web site, being divided into customization files (CSS and JavaScript), data organization (.xml) and content (images or flash).

With all these elements configured, you will then need to link your web site to an [account name](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-account-name) and a trade policy, in a process called [binding](/en/tutorial/what-is-binding).
