Your store codes are written in the CMS **templates**. When the store gains access to Admin, for example, the `Home` template is the one that contains the code of the site's *homepage*.

But let's say you create a new `Home2` template and want to display it on the homepage. How does the platform know that it is the `Home2` template that should be shown on the homepage, not the `Home` template?

To indicate this, you need to associate the desired template with the **layout**, which is in the site folder structure within Sites and Channels.

This association is made in the layout properties setting. To get there, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, acesse **Storefront > Layout > CMS** and click on **Sites and channels**.
2. Click on the website of the store you are editing.
3. Click on the root folder (`/`).
4. Search for the layout you want to edit.
5. Click on the **Template** drop-down. There will be listed the templates configured in HTML Templates.
6. Select the template you want to associate with this layout.
7. Type `yes` to confirm the change (this step is necessary because this is a critical change for the site, as the page's front-end will be replaced).
