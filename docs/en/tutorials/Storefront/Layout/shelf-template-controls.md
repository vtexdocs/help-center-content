Products attributes can be stored in variables, and these are used in every template. To declare the variables and receive an attribute of a product, use the following command: `#set ($variable=$attribute)`

### Examples

- `#set($id = $product.Id)`  
- `#set($uri = $product.Uri)`  
- `#set($escapedName = $product.HtmlEscapedName)`  
- `#set($evaluationRate = $product.EvaluationRate)`
