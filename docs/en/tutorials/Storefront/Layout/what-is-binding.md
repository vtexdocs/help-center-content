Website binding is what bridges the CMS (Portal) with the information defined in the License Manager for a specific account name.

That is, it sets that an __account name__ (configured in the License Manager module) is linked to the folder and files structure of a particular __Website__ (defined in the CMS module).

This is the setting made when an account wants to have more than one store. For each of these stores (which we call [multistores](/en/tutorial/creating-multi-store-multi-domain)), you make a binding.
