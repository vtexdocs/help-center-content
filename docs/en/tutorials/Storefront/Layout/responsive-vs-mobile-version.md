### Responsive

The design is the same for accesses made from desktops, smartphones, tablets or notebooks. The difference is how the design is presented. The whole layout is automatically adjusted according to the resolution of the device.

### Mobile Version

The design of the mobile version, as well as its whole programming, are only intended for mobile devices, being a second application. In other words, there is one application for usual browsers, and another one for mobile browsers. Upon accessing the store, the device will be identified and the specific programming will be redirected.

Main mobile and desktop screen resolutions currently in use (there can be variations according to the device used):

 - 320 x 480
 - 480 x 320
 - 768 x 1024
 - 1024 x 768
 - 1680 x 1050

#### Some strengths of RESPONSIVE should be taken into account

 - Improved SEO indexation (although the dedicated site has a similar quality).
 - Easy updates and operational maintenance.
 - Improved loading and better conversion of external and internal redirecting codes.
 - The same look & feel benefits the visual identity and branding.
 - Single URLs facilitates campaign actions.

#### RESPONSIVE and MOBILE VERSION Characteristics

 - No mouse over.
 - Smart scripts. Reduces the number of help actions in site performance.
 - Large images weigh on loading, and they are not opened often (zoom).
 - Summarized posts and direct calls provide better adherence.
 - Viewing is 100% vertical.
 - Visual elements (images except for the productâ€™s picture) must be simple.
 - Differences regarding size and color are more evident that in the traditional store.
 - The average browsing time is much shorter, that is, it must be objective, particularly regarding product searches.
 - The visibility of the window display is much more limited, so, a good classification in categories makes a difference.

#### Quality is the same regardless of the size!

Just like any other design creation, points are not totally correct or totally wrong. The secret is to incorporate a larger sample of end users and understand our principal commercial bargains and good usability practices.
