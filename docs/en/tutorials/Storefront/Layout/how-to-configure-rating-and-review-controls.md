This article is intended to show you how to use rating and review controls.

## Controls responsible

`vtex.cmc:evaluationRate` – Consumer rating (stars)

_Returns total classifications made by users_


`vtex.cmc:UserReview` – Ratings and comments

_Adds an option to rate and the results of ratings, a form for comments and a view of comments made_


`vtex.cmc:welcomeMessage` – User login

_Responsible for creating the IPI cookie used by the UserReview control. Without it, when trying to make a review, the login will be required in a loop.._

## Concepts and use

These controls, unlike the others, will only work if specifically configured, as shown below:

Click on **new rating** and fill in the Name and Text fields, then save.

Now your Review and Rating controls are ready to be used.
