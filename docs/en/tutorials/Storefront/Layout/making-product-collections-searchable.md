>⚠️ **Warning**: VTEX has two search options - VTEX search and VTEX Intelligent Search. This article refers to the VTEX search. To learn more about the VTEX Intelligent Search application, see <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb">this track</a>.

You can make it possible for the user to find products associated with a specific collection when searching for it by name on the store's page.

For example: you have a collection called "Children's day" and mark it as searchable. If a customer searches for the term "Children's Day", the products that are part of this collection will be displayed as results of the search.

>⚠️ **Warning:** there are two ways to configure collections, through the CMS or the Collection module (Beta). This article is about how to <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-collections-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L">configure collections through the CMS</a>.

To make a collections searchable, follow the steps below:

1. Access __Storefront__ > __Layout__.
2. Click on the CMS folder and select the __Product Clusters (Collections)__ folder.
3. Select the collection you wish to edit.
4. Tick the __Searchable__ box.
5. Click on __Save Product Cluster__.
