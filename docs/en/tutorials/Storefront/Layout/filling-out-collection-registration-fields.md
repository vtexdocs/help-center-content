>⚠️ **Warning:** there are two ways to configure collections, through the CMS or the Collection module (Beta). This article is about how to <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-collections-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L">configure collections through the CMS</a>.

To better understand the meaning of the registration fields of a product collection, check out the full description of each one below: 

- __Product Cluster ID__: Number that identifies the product collection. This field will be filled out automatically by the system when saving the new collection. 

- __Name__: Name that identifies the product collection. This field is mandatory and should be filled solely with letters, number and hyphen. The hyphen must not be used at the beginning or at the end of the name.

- __Highlight?__: This option should be checked if you want the collection to be highlighted in your store, by using the `$product.HightLight` control. For more on this control, read the following article: [Shelf Template Controls](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/shelf-template-controls--tutorials_550).

- __Searchable?__: This should be checked to make the collection searchable in [VTEX's search API](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/facets-1#facetscategoryandspecification). 

- __From/To__: time interval during which the product collection will be active in your store.
