A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions of a website to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement, conversions, and other relevant metrics. The purpose of A/B testing is to identify which version (A or B) has higher success rates and better results.

Native A/B testing tools are not available for Legacy CMS Portal stores. However, you can still leverage third-party solutions such as [Optimizely's](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack-experimentation/docs/welcome) [A/B testing solution](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack-experimentation/docs/run-a-b-tests). This tool enables you to create and manage A/B tests, allowing you to analyze the performance of different website versions in a controlled environment.

## Use cases for A/B testing
On VTEX, A/B testing can be conducted using the following store development technologies:

| Technology | Is native A/B testing possible?   | Reference    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| CMS Portal Legado - VTEX IO (Store Framework) | Yes     | [A/B testing Legacy and IO store versions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-performing-ab-testing-between-legacy-and-io)     |
| CMS Portal Legado - FastStore | No | - |
| VTEX IO (Store Framework) - VTEX IO (Store Framework)   | No | - |
| VTEX IO (Store Framework) - FastStore     | No | - |
| FastStore - FastStore  | No | - |

## A/B testing between Legacy CMS Portal and VTEX IO store versions

If you are considering migrating your store to VTEX IO and want to compare the performance of your current store against a VTEX IO version through A/B testing, see the [A/B testing Legacy and IO store versions guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-performing-ab-testing-between-legacy-and-io). This guide provides instructions on how to conduct A/B tests between store workspaces from the Legacy CMS Portal and VTEX IO.

By running an A/B test between these two store versions, you can analyze the impact of transitioning to VTEX IO on user engagement, conversions, and overall performance.
