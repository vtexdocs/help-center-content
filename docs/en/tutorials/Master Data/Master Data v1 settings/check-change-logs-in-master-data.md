At VTEX, logs function as a detailed account of changed made to an online store. Once the platform undergoes any configuration, the related information is stored on a databank called [Master Data](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw "Master Data").

Within the ecommerce scenario, some configurations may be applied without exactly knowing the reason behind it. In such cases, the retailer can ascertain the origin of these actions by consulting the logs.

To access your store's logs, refer to the following step-by-step:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data.**
2. Click on the __triple bar__ next to "Clients" under the Profile System session.
3. Select the __document__ you wish to look at.
4. In the lower right corner of the page, click on __Changelogs.__
5. Filter by desired __field.__

The screen will then display an account of the changes made on the VTEX platform.

<div class= “alert alert-info”>
Notice: in the lower right corner of the page in the "changelogs" option, you can select "show more logs". This option allows you to view a larger number of logs by page. However, each document has a limit of data that it can display per screen.
