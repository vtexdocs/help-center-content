This scenario usually happens because of an inconsistency in the user's registration fields. To verify it, we need to access this customer's data in your store's __Profile System__.

Follow the steps below to validate the information:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data**.
2. In the __Profile System__ box, click __Customers__.
3. Select the option __Email__ and search the client's email.![e-mail - Master Data](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/cjpYKSZ1i8USYqs8Yga4E/df2c4793391483458ffcf8209a222f69/e-mail_-_Master_Data.png)
4. Click the customer record to access the profile details.

In the __Contact__ section, you will see that the `Is Company?` option is filled with the value `No`. At the same time, in the section __Company Data__, you will see that the `Document Type` field is filled with the value `cnpj`.

This means that the client data that is loaded for individuals, because of the field `Is Company?: No`. However, the `Document Type` is set to `cnpj`, creating inconsistency.

To resolve this issue, you must change the `Document Type` field to `cpf`.
