Creating a cluster of customers is the same as segmenting them. These two approaches give the storeowner a better idea of the customer’s profile, and enable you to be more proactive in dealing with this user.

These details, once obtained, are very useful for the company’s marketing and advertising. Each store can define its own clusters and the rules for a customer to be included in each of them.

The purpose of this article is to show how to configure your CRM to create a cluster.

<ol start="1">
    <li>The first step is to create a field in MasterData with the name of the desired cluster. Example: Resellers. This way, customers who are resellers will be highlighted, receiving an exclusive promotion, for example. <a href="https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/como-crio-um-campo-no-master-data">Access our manual on how to create a field.</a></li>
</ol>

>ℹ️ For a cluster to work correctly in a promotion, define the newly created custom field as **searchable** and **filterable** in MasterData.

<ol start="2">
    <li>The second step is to create this field in the form so that it is possible to view the data. <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-crio-um-campo-no-master-data">For that, see our manual.</a></li>
</ol>

So technically, a cluster in CRM is nothing more than a field.

To populate this field you can use an [import worksheet](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/importing-data-into-master-data--tutorials_1135 "How to import data into Master Data") or an API, or you can do it manually using the Customer form in CRM. Everything depends on the store’s strategy for clusterizing its customers.
