The import of customer data must be made in Master Data. To find out more about sending data, use this article on [Importing data to Master Data](/en/tutorial/importing-data-into-master-data).

>❗ This article refers to Master Data v1 fields specifically for stores in **Brazil**. You should check for valid values for different countries.
>
> You can also see the guide on [how to import customer information programattically using the Master Data v2 API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/import-customer-data).

The checkout works with CL (customer) and AD (address) entities data.

Please note that, for checkout to display the customer's data in the chart based on the email, you must ensure that all the following data is correctly registered in Master Data.

The tables below include the data and the formats required for the import.  

### Client

| Field Name | Description | Format |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| firstName | Customer name | Text |
| lastName | Customer surname | Text |
| email | Customer email | Email |
| documentType | Document Type | "cpf" for Brazil |
| document | Document (CPF) | 11 digits, without mask |
| homePhone | Telephone | In "+5511999999999" format, +55 being the country code, followed by the area code and the phone number. |

The `id` field is generated by the system right after the import, and it will be used as “userld” when importing the address.

Customers’ ‘userId’ field should be left blank, since it will not be used now. It will be generated by the system after the first purchase made by the customer.

For clients that are **legal entities**, the document and documentType fields are not mandatory and the following additional fields must be filled in:

| Field Name | Description | Format |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| isCorporate | Defines whether the customer is a legal entity | Should be "true" |
| corporateName | Corporate name | Text |
| tradeName | Trade name | Text |
| stateRegistration | State registration | Should be "Exempt" or text/alphanumeric value |
| corporateDocumet | CNPJ | 14 digits, without input mask |

### Address

Customers must have at least one address.

| Field Name | Description | Format |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| id | Address ID | blank |
| userId | Customer ID | `id` field, generated after customers import. |
| addressName | Address name | Text or alphanumeric value |
| addressType | Address type | Must be "residential" or "commercial" |
| country | Country code | "BRA" for Brazil. |
| state | State | Two letters |

If data (customer or address) is not consistent, including a valid CPF (a Brazilian ID number unique for each Brazilian citizen) or CNPJ (Brazilian company registration number), the checkout will not fill in the customer's data, and he/she will make the purchase as a new user.
