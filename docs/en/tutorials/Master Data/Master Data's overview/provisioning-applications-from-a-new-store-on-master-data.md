When creating a new store in License Manager and accessing your Master Data, the forms needed to access client entity data, addresses, etc,  cannot be found.

You need to provision an application containing these forms.    

How to proceed: 

1. Access the store's Master Data in LOJA.vtexcrm.com.br and log in
2. Access LOJA.vtexcrm.com.br/api/crm/pvt/provisioning (the result is a blank page)
3. In Master Data, access the **Advanced area**
4. Clear the cache
5. Return to the apps list 
6. Click on **Reload applications**
