The VTEX Master Data Trigger configuration has a property called __weight__.

It's an integer field in which you can put a number between 0 and 100. This number is a percentage value of distribution between triggers.

This feature works only if you have at least two actions with value in the `weight` property. 

Example 1: A/B Test between two triggers with 50% of load.

```json
    {
    	"properties": { ... },
    	"v-triggers": [
    		{
    			"name": "scenario-1",
    			"weight": 50,
          ...
    		},
    		{
    			"name": "scenario-2",
    			"weight": 50,
          ...
    		}
    	]
    }
```

Example 2: A/B Test between four triggers with different weights.
```json
    {
    	"properties": { ... },
    	"v-triggers": [
    		{
    			"name": "scenario-1",
    			"weight": 40,
          ...
    		},
    		{
    			"name": "scenario-2",
    			"weight": 30,
          ...
    		},
    		{
    			"name": "scenario-3",
    			"weight": 20,
          ...
    		},
    		{
    			"name": "scenario-4",
    			"weight": 10,
          ...
    		}
    	]
    }
```
