Each VTEX account has a single [Sponsor user](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-sponsor-user) – the only one who is granted full access to every section in the Admin, including critical maintenance and authorization actions. By default, this role is assigned to a user specified in your contract, usually the person overseeing digital commerce operations on a daily basis.

The current Sponsor user may transfer this responsibility to anyone they desire through the [Sponsor Management](#sponsor-management) page, by following the [steps in the ownership transfer flow](#transferring-account-ownership).

The current Sponsor user can also check the activity log for all ownership transfers that have been made since the creation of the VTEX account.

If they are unavailable, a legal representative for the company may fill out a form to request a manual store ownership transfer under [exceptional circumstances](#exceptional-circumstances).

## Sponsor Management

The __Account settings__ page allows you to identify the current account sponsor, transfer store ownership, and view the activity log associated with the actions of the account holder. To access the page, click on your **profile avatar** on the VTEX Admin top bar, marked by the initial of your email, and click on **Account settings** > **Account**.

### Transferring account ownership

Before you start, make sure the user who will be granted the Sponsor role already has access to the account. If they don't, you should [create a new user](/en/docs/tutorials/managing-admin-users#creating-a-new-user) for them before you proceed.

To transfer store ownership, follow these steps:

1. On the VTEX Admin top bar, click on your **profile avatar**, marked by the initial of your email.
2. Click on **Account settings** > **Account**.
3. In the __Sponsor__ section, click on `Sponsor Management`.
4. Click `Transfer anyway`.
5. Enter the email address of the new Sponsor user and click `Next`.
6. Read the terms and indicate your consent by clicking on the checkbox.
7. Click on `Send invite`.

An email will be sent to the new Sponsor user and will expire in 72 hours. The current Sponsor user can cancel the invitation by clicking on `Cancel` or resend it by clicking on `Resend email` while waiting for confirmation.

### Accepting the invitation

To accept the invitation, the new Sponsor user must follow these steps:

1. Open the email that was sent to your inbox and click on `View invitation`.
2. Log in to the VTEX Admin with the account associated with the invitation.
3. Read the terms and indicate your consent by clicking on the checkbox.
4. Click on `Accept Invitation`.

Once you complete these steps, the ownership transfer will be completed, and it will no longer be possible to cancel the invitation. If there are any issues, you can request assistance to revert or modify the transfer under [exceptional circumstances](#exceptional-circumstances).

## View history of store ownership changes

The Sponsor user is responsible for critical maintenance and authorization actions, so mistakes made by this user role can have drastic consequences. Therefore, it is essential to track changes related to this user role. To monitor and audit account ownership transfers, you can access the activity log on the Sponsor management page by clicking on the `Activity Log` button on **Account settings** > **Account**. 

All events related to the transfer of account ownership are logged in the activity log with the date they occurred and the user associated with the event.

> ℹ️ You can also audit various actions of users in your account with the [Audit](/en/docs/tutorials/audit) module.

## Exceptional circumstances

If the Sponsor user is not available to perform the transfer of ownership through the VTEX Admin, a legal representative of the company can fill out a form to request a manual transfer of store ownership. Check below the step by step for each region.
