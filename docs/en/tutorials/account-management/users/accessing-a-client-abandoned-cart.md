The abandoned cart is a feature used for clients who are dropping a purchase. In such cases, the store can set an email that will be sent to the user, with the purpose of
reminding him or her of the items that were not purchased.

The store can check some information about the items "left" in the cart using [Master Data](/tutorial/what-is-master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw). For example:

- SKUs
- Quantity
- Sellers
- Cart status

Viewing these fields is very simple. Once logged in to your store Admin, just follow the steps below.

1. In the Admin sidebar, click __Master Data__;
