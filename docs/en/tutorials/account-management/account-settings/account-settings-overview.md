Every VTEX client receives an account that has access to the Admin, where you can manage important aspects of your ecommerce.

In the **Account Settings** section, you can control access to the Admin and change other account-related settings, such as editing contact information and linking stores to your account.

To access the _Account Settings_ page, click on your **profile avatar**, which can be identified by the first letter of your email address, and click on **Account Settings**.

This section includes the following pages, soon to be included in Admin v4.

## User Roles

This page defines which features can be viewed and/or edited by the user within each module of the platform. For more information, see the article [Roles](/en/tutorial/como-criar-perfil-de-acesso/).

## Account

On this page, you can access basic data about the online store, domain and multidomain settings, access keys for APIs, company logo, and contact information. For more information, see the article [Account details page](/en/tutorial/account-details-page--2vhUVOKfCaswqLguT2F9xq).

## Authentication

On this page, you can choose login options for store customers to access their account, and for admin users to access the admin panel. For more information, see the article [Authentication](/en/tutorial/pagina-de-autenticacao--21CkKHLKP1o41lUpGhuRUs).

## Users

This page displays a list of users with their name, email, and multifactor authentication (MFA) settings. It also allows you to search, export, create, edit, and delete users. For more information, see the article [How to Manage Users](/en/tutorial/gerenciando-usuarios/).

## Application Keys

On this page, you can manage application keys, which are used to connect your VTEX account to external systems via API. These keys are used to grant secure access to the data you want to share with these integrations, without exposing your account to unauthorized users or applications. For more information, see the article [Application Keys](/en/tutorial/chaves-de-aplicacao--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet).
