To [access invoices](/en/docs/tutorials/understanding-the-value-of-approved-revenues#relatorio-financeiro) and other financial information in your account, you need to associate a financial role with all users authorized to view this information.

There are two predefined financial [roles](/en/docs/tutorials/roles): [Finance](/en/docs/tutorials/roles#finance) and [Finance Full Access](/en/docs/tutorials/roles#finance-full-access). We will use the Finance role as a reference for this article, but the steps detailed below are the same for both roles.

## How to associate users with the financial access profile

You can associate a user with the existing **Finance** profile:

8. In VTEX Admin, click the logged-in user's initials in the top right corner.  
9. Click **Account settings**.  
10. Click **User Roles**.  
11. Click `New Role`.  
12. Select the **Finance** profile.  
13. Add users to this access profile.  
14. Click `Save`.

The financial access profile is now created and available to be associated with existing users.
