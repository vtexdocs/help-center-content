__Store name__ is the identification of a store on the VTEX platform. It functions as a subaccount of the parent account (also called the [__account name__](/en/docs/tutorials/what-is-an-account-name)), and is subordinate to it.

See this guide to learn how you can [create a store name](/en/tutorial/how-to-create-a-store-name).

Another important detail is that a __store name__ can only be bound to one __account name__, whereas the latter can have multiple subaccounts.
