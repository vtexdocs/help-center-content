This article aims to outline some good practices regarding the use of the images of your products. 

The table below shows the size limits and formats accepted for each image:

| **File size and format** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Maximum size in pixels | 5,000 x 5,000 pixels |
| Minimum size in pixels | 600 x 600 pixels |
| Maximum size in MB | 4 MB |
| Minimum size in KB | 300 KB |
| Allowed file extensions | <ul><li>JPG</li><li>PNG</li><li>GIF</li><li>ICO</li><li>SVG</li><li>WEBP</li></ul> |

## Recommendations

In order to get good results with your images and solve possible import problems, follow the suggestions below:

- The name of the image files should not contain spaces. If necessary, we recommend that the characters be hyphenated.
- Do not use special characters in the image names. Follow an alphanumeric pattern.
- The recommended file extension is .JPG (not .JPEG).
- We recommend that your images have a white background.
- The format of the images should preferably be square, to avoid distortions.
- For image zooming to work correctly, we recommend that the images have a size of at least 1000 pixels. If possible, you can achieve an even better zoom result with images from 1500 to 2000 pixels.
- We do not recommend stretching the image so it does not affect its quality.
