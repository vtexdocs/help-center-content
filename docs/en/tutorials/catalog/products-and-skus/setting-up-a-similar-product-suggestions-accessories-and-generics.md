On the VTEX platform, you can manage your store's product listing page using cross-sell and upsell strategies.

## What is cross-selling?

Offering a complementary item related to what the customer is purchasing during their shopping experience. For example, when buying a phone, the customer might also be interested in headphones or a case for the new device.

## What is upselling?

Offering a higher-end version of the item the customer is purchasing. For a phone, this could mean presenting another model with more features or offering the option to upgrade from wired headphones to a Bluetooth version.

## Cross-selling and upselling in the VTEX platform

See below the possible cross-sell and upsell relationships between SKUs:

* **Accessories:** Complementary items suggested for the main product. Customers can select accessory items on the product listing page using a checkbox.
* **Suggestions:** Product recommendations. A SKU will only be displayed as a suggestion when its price is higher than the price of the item being sold.
* **Similar products:** Alternatives to the selected item or products with similar characteristics.
* **Show together:** Suggestions to buy items together.

>ℹ️ These product listing page settings can be associated with the [Buy Together](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tutorials/buy-together) promotion.

## Configuring cross-selling and upselling strategies

You configure this at the SKU level in one of the following ways:

* ***Via VTEX Admin:** Manually when [adding or editing the SKU](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tutorials/adding-or-editing-skus), or in bulk, [using a spreadsheet](https://help.vtex.com/en/docs/tutorials/exporting-and-importing-product-and-sku-specifications).  
* **Via API Reference:** Using the [Catalog API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#overview).
