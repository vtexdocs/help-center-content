> ⚠️ This article applies only to the **Notify me** feature in stores that use [Legacy CMS Portal](/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj). For stores using [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/what-is-vtex-io), it is necessary to follow the instructions on the [Availability Notify](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-availability-notify) guide.

To export the data of customers who registered on the availability notification option ([Notify me](/en/docs/tutorials/setting-up-the-notify-me-option)), follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __Reports__.
3. Click on the __Inventory Shortage__ tab.
4. Click __Export__.
5. If you wish, select filters to refine your query by clicking __Filter results or do a search__.

    We recommend exporting a maximum of 10,000 records at a time. If the number is higher than this, the process may take longer.
5. Check that your email is correct in the __Notification e-mail__ field. The report will be sent to the email you entered in this field.
5. Click `Export list with names`.
6. After your request has been processed, you can opt to __Click here to download your file__, if you wish.

    You will also receive the report with the requested information by email.
