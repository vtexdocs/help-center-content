> ⚠️ The [List](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-list--4b4NsVFwA8kwqS8S82w4Go) feature is exclusive to stores that use Legacy CMS Portal.

This article will discuss the details for creation of a type of Voucher List, which is a special type of List. [See our List Type documentation by clicking here.](/en/tutorial/creating-a-type-of-list/)

The settings depend on the two points listed below.

## SKU Setup

To create this type of list, an SKU must be set up as follows:

- The SKU price must be R$0.01.
- The SKU must be set up to generate a credit voucher.

## List Types Settings

The creation of this type of list requires that in the List Types settings the delivery is marked as “Value of products purchased will be converted into a gift card voucher”. See the example image.

Save your list after you have defined all settings.

Upon the creation of voucher-type lists on the website, the lists will automatically generate vouchers for list members.

## Pre-view

On **List types**, the credits generated by this type of lists can be viewed on the listing of lists in the delivery column. To check the voucher, only click on the link.
