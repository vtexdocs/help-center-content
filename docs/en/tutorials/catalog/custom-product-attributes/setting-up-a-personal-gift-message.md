To make gifts with personal messages available for your store's clients, you have to set up a new SKU service on VTEX Admin, as explained in the article [Creating service for a SKU](https://help.vtex.com/docs/tutorials/creating-service-for-a-sku).

After creating the service and defining its value, follow the steps below to register a type of service for the SKU:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog > Custom Product Attributes__, or type __Custom Product Attributes__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __Service Types__.
3. Register or select the desired type of service.
4. Click on the __Service Values__ tab.
5. Register a new values table by selecting the type of service that was registered previously.
6. Proceed to __Catalog > Products and SKUs__.
7. Select a product.
8. On the `SKUs` tab, click the desired SKU.
9. On the __Customization__ section, click `+` > __Services__.
10. Fill in the fields and click `Apply`.

> ℹ️ After setting up the SKU service, wait for the indexing process for the registration to be effective on the website. Once the service is active, you will be able to test the purchase.

## Validating the configuration

To confirm whether the settings are correct, follow the steps below:

1. On your store's website, go to the page of the SKU that was set up.
2. Add the SKU to the cart.
3. The type of service should be available for selection. Select the service in the cart and click on the link to add a message.

You can view the written message on __My Account > My Orders__.
