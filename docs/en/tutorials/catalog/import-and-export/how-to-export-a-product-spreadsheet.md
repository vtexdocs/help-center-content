On VTEX platform, you can export a spreadsheet with the [products](/en/docs/tutorials/adding-or-editing-products) you have in your store.

Here's the step-by-step to do so:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click __Import and Export__.
  Make sure you are in the __Products and SKUs__ tab.
3. Click __Export/Import__.
4. Fill in the field with the __email__ to which you want to send the spreadsheet.
5. Click `Export to Excel`.

Then check the inbox for the selected email. If the operation has worked, the user will have received an email with a link to download the complete spreadsheet.

> ⚠️ This only works properly when you're dealing with up to 10,000 products. If the required value is greater than this limit, the system does not send the spreadsheet to the email. Use the filters to refine your search.
