The Category is the second level of categorization of your store, just under the Department level. Categories are forms of classification or organization used to present the products of your store.

When creating an e-commerce, it is recommended to have categories and sometimes subcategories to make life easier for users, ensuring that they quickly find the products they are looking for.

The categories are organized by hierarchical levels, such as a family, so the __Parent category__ (category) is above the __Child categories__ (subcategories), but they are still part of the same family.

When you create categories for your store, think thoroughly about the structure of what you sell. If you have a furniture store, for example, you might have the categories Sofa, Bed and Bookcase, and the following subcategories:



__Sofa (Parent) __


2 places (Child)


3 places (Child)


4 places (Child)


---


__Bed (Parent) __


Single (Child)


Couple (Child)


Queen (Child)


King (Child)

---

__Bookcase (Parent) __


2 shelves (Child)


3 shelves (Child)


4 shelves (Child)

Having an organized and clear structure is an important part of product mapping, marketing strategy and therefore the success of your e-commerce.
