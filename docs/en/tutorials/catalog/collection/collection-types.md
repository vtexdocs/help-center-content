Collections is a resource for grouping products. It is common to use this tool to create commercial actions with similar themes or criteria, such as a winter clothing collection, for example.

With the development of the Collections module (Beta), it became easier to configure collections. This article explains the different ways to configure collections on VTEX.

On VTEX, there are three ways to configure Collections:

- Manual
- Automatic
- Hybrid

| Collection  | Where to configure   | Adding products  | Ordering    |
| ---------- | -----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manual | CMS and Collections module (Beta) | In CMS: by SKU selection In Collections (Beta): by search refinement and product filters |In CMS: no controlIn Collections (Beta): total control | 
| Automatic | CMS | Created by Brand or Category filters | No control |  
| Hybrid | CMS and Collections module (Beta) | Created by Brand or Category filters. You can also add products manually | No control        |

> ⚠️ Collections created in the CMS module and with more than one <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/cadastro-de-colecoes-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L">group</a> cannot be reordered in the new Beta Collection module. We recommend you do not change the ordering, as it may compromise the efficiency of the functionality.

  ## Manual collections

In order to have a specific selection of products, manual collections can be configured both in the Collections module (Beta) and in the CMS. In this scenario, products are added to the collection manually.

In the Collections module (Beta), there are more flexible options and more control in collection ordering. You can refine products via search or filters. Thus, the management of which products will be included in the collection is more precise and optimized.

To learn how to add manual collections, read our article [Create Beta Collections](/tutorial/cadastrar-colecoes-beta--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye).

## Automatic collections   

Automatic collections are updated according to the configured filters. You cannot arrange the items in the collection. Products are added through filters and automatically updated according to them.

### Example

You create a collection from a filter within the T-shirt category. When you add a new product to this category, it will be automatically added to the collection.

To configure automatic collections, read our article [Add Collections via CMS](/en/tutorial/cadastro-de-colecoes-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L).

## Hybrid collections

Hybrid collections have manual and automatic characteristics. The advantage of these collections is to combine automatic updating by filters with optimized product selection.

You can add products manually and configure automatic filters. These collections can be created and edited both in the CMS and in the Collections module (Beta).

To configure hybrid collections, read the articles [Add Collections via CMS](/en/tutorial/cadastro-de-colecoes-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L) and [Create Beta Collections](/en/tutorial/creating-beta-collections--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye).
