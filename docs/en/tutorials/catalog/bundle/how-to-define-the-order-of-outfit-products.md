The outfit is a product and SKU intended to group other SKUs. The difference between the outfit and a normal bundle is that the outfit enables the separate purchase of its SKUs.

However, doubts arise regarding the order of these products on the product page. Currently, the order of the products follows the SKU ID of the SKUs included in the bundle.

That is, if the outfit includes the **6, 30, 14 and 10** SKUs, the ordering on the product page will be as follows:

- 6
- 10
- 14
- 30

A customized order can be created on the product page by using JavaScript.
