A bundle is an SKU composed of one or more SKUs. SKUs that make up a bundle are called __components__.

In a standard bundle, the products are sold together, i.e. they can not be offered for sale separately. This means that in a "Beach" bundle consisting of the SKUs "Trunks" and Towel, the customer will only be able to purchase the SKUs together.

However, you can also choose another bundle mode, called __Outfit__, in which component SKUs are displayed together, but __can be sold separately__.

In both cases, the bundle SKU will consider the component stocks and the SKU price of the bundle.
