> ⚠️ VTEX has two search options - Legacy CMS Portal search and VTEX Intelligent Search. This article refers to the Legacy CMS Portal search. To learn more about VTEX Intelligent Search, see [this track](/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb).

If you need to use in your products words that perhaps are not important for the search engine, several good practices exist:

- Use product specification, redirecting the search term to the filter.
- Use collection, redirecting the search term to a landing-page.
- Redirect the search term to a search context that makes sense (Category, brand or the product itself).

Learn how to set up redirection on the [URL Mapping (301 Redirect)](/en/docs/tutorials/url-mapping-301-redirect/) guide.
