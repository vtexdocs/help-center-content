![Seller-EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/promotions-&-taxes/promotions/progressive-discount_7.png)

Select one of the following options for applying the promotion:

- **Same as:** The promotion will only be applied to specific sellers. After selecting this option, complete the field that will display the names of the desired sellers.
- **Different from:** Define the sellers that will not be affected by this promotion. After selecting "Different from", you can choose the sellers you don't want to include in the campaign. All other sellers will be included.

### Trade policies
In the right-hand corner of the page, in the section **Trade policies**, select the trade policies valid for the discount. You can give discounts for trade policies when [your store acts as a marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/pt/faq/o-que-e-um-marketplace) (**My store**) or as a seller (**Third-party stores - Fulfillment**).

You can choose from the following options:

- **All:** Select this option to apply the promotion to all trade policies without any restrictions. All products, regardless of the associated trade policy, will be included in the promotion.
- **Equal to**: This option allows you to determine the policies that will apply to the products eligible for the discount.
- **Different from:** This option removes specific policies, ensuring the discount is not applied to products that use those business rules.

![Politica comercial-EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/promotions-&-taxes/promotions/progressive-discount_8.png)

## Set the conditions for the Progressive Discount promotion
Determine the conditions and discount percentages to be applied. See the available conditions below:

- **SKUs:** Select the SKUs that the progressive discount will apply to. This option restricts the promotion to products associated with the selected SKUs.
- **Collections:** Select the product [collections](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criando-colecao-de-produtos--tutorials_244) that the progressive discount will apply to. This option allows you to apply the promotion to a group of predefined products.
- **Must be the same item:** This option restricts the discount to products that are the same. For example, if you add different SKUs from the same collection, the promotion won't be applied. The rule only checks the quantity of the single SKU in the cart.
- **Discount:** Set the discount percentage applied when the minimum quantity of items defined is reached. You can create up to 10 progressive discount ranges.
- **Add range:** Configure additional progressive discount levels. For example, you can define a 5% discount with a quantity of 10, and an increase to 10% when the quantity reaches 20. The maximum number of configurable ranges is 10.
