>ℹ️ There are two ways to configure collections, through the **CMS** or using the **Collections (Beta)** module. This article is about configuring collections through the **Collections (Beta)** module.
>
> This feature is in Beta stage and available for environments starting from Admin v3. If you have any questions, please [contact our Support team](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests" target="_blank).

The new __Collections (Beta)__ module allows you to create and manage collections in a practical and quick way. 

By grouping related products into collections, you create a discovery process for your customers, leading them to find new products, buy more, and have a better buying experience.

This article explains how to:

- Create a new collection.
- Add or remove products from the collection.
- Change the item position in the collection.
- Export your collection as a spreadsheet.
- Edit or delete a collection.

## Prerequisite

To create a collection, you must have the _Owner (Admin Super)_ [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/access-profiles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc?locale=en) or create another role with the **Write Collections** feature enabled in the **Collections** section of the **Catalog** profiles. Find out more on our documentation about [Creating a role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/access-profiles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc?locale=pt#creating-a-role).

## Create a collection

Follow the step by step below to add a new collection:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog**, or type **Catalog** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on **Collections**.
3. Click on the `Create Collection` button.
4. Fill in the [Collection fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/cadastrar-colecoes-beta--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye#collection-data-fields).
5. Click on `Create` to update the information filled in the form.
6. Then, [select the products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/cadastrar-colecoes-beta--yJBHqNMViOAnnnq4fyOye#products-selection) that will be part of the collection.

>ℹ️ Note that the collections created in this module are not automatically changed. Automatic collections - made by applying filters - cannot be configured in the module.

### Collection data fields

To better understand the meaning of the data fields of a products collection, the complete description of each is given below:

#### New Collection settings

- **Collection Name:** the collection's name. This is a mandatory field.
- **Simple description:** description for internal use, with the collection's details. It will not be used for search engines.
- **Add products automatically:** automatically include products in the collection based on the selected criteria.

#### Schedule

- **Start date:**: collection start date and time. If a future date and time are set, the collection will have a scheduled status.
- **Schedule collection end date:** selection that allows setting an expiration date and time for the collection
- **End date:** collection end date and time. This field is displayed only if **Schedule collection end date** is enabled.

#### Enable

- **Add collection tag:** select this option if you want the collection to highlight specific products using a tag.
- **Make collection searchable:** option to make the collection searchable in the store.

### Products selection

Products can be added either by selecting items from the __Collection__ module list or importing a spreadsheet in CSV or XML format.

#### Via VTEX Admin

Selecting products through the VTEX Admin can be made using the product list, search bar and filters. You can search for a product using these parameters:

- Product name.
- Product ID.
- SKU name.
- SKU ID.
- Product Reference.

There are many filters that can be selected to reduce the number of products displayed on the list.

![Collections-EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_1.png)

You can create new filters based on other criteria not covered by the predetermined filters. The images below show a few examples of these options:

![Novo filtro - EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_2.PNG)

![Filtro Colecao detalhes - EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_3.png)

To add a product to a collection, click on the icon <i class="fas fa-plus-circle" title = "check circle"></i> related to the product, thereby saving it in the collection automatically.

For more information about the item, click on the icon <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" title = "external link"></i> to open the product page or click on the image to enlarge it.

![EN-colecao-adicionar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_4.gif)

If you want to add in bulk, apply one of the filters and click on the `Add All` button. It is worth noting that the product must have at least one existing SKU to be included in a collection.

![EN-colecao-adicionar-todos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_5.png)

>❗ <p> Do not bulk add more than 150,000 products. This may affect the indexing of the Catalog and the operation of your store.

#### By spreadsheet

>ℹ️ The maximum limit for import and export is 10,000 SKUs per operation.

You can also add items to a collection using a spreadsheet by following the steps below:

  1. In your collection's dashboard, click on the `Import` button.

  5. Fill in the spreadsheet with the Product IDs, RefIDs, or SKUs. Add a single ID on each line. Regardless of which ID you fill in, all SKUs for the selected product will be added to the collection after import.
  6. After filling out the spreadsheet, save the changes, and import the document into the VTEX Admin. You can drop the file in the indicated area or click on **Choose a file**. Files in CSV or XML format are accepted.
  7. To finish, click on `Import`.
