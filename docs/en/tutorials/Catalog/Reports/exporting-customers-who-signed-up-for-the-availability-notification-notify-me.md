<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>This article applies only to the <strong>Notify me</strong> feature in stores that use <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj">Legacy CMS Portal</a>. For stores using <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/what-is-vtex-io">VTEX IO</a>, it is necessary to follow the instructions on the <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-availability-notify">Availability Notify</a> guide.</p>
</div>

To export the data of customers who registered on the availability notification option ([Notify me](/en/tutorial/setting-up-the-notify-me-option--2VqVifQuf6Co2KG048Yu6e)), follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __Reports__.
3. Click on the __Inventory Shortage__ tab.
4. Click __Export__.
5. If you wish, select filters to refine your query by clicking __Filter results or do a search__.

    We recommend exporting a maximum of 10,000 records at a time. If the number is higher than this, the process may take longer.
5. Check that your email is correct in the __Notification e-mail__ field. The report will be sent to the email you entered in this field.
5. Click `Export list with names`.
6. After your request has been processed, you can opt to __Click here to download your file__, if you wish.

    You will also receive the report with the requested information by email.
