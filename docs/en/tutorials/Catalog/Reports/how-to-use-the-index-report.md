The **Index Report** shows the indexing status of all products of the store.

>ℹ️ **Notice:** For more information, access [Understanding the operation of the indexation.](/en/tutorial/understanding-how-indexation-works)

## How to access the index report

The path is as follows:
1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog**, or type **Catalog** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on **Reports**.
3. Click on the tab **Indexed Products**.

## Meaning of the groups of products

In the report, products are divided into established groups according to their status:

1. **Total Indexed**: Number or percentage of products correctly indexed. 
2. **Not yet in Queue ** (Ainda não enfileirado): Number and percentage of products not yet in queue to join the indexing queue.
3. **Total in Queue** (Total na Fila): Number and percentage of products that are standing in the indexing queue.
4. **In Queue Recently** (Na Fila recentemente): Number and percentage of products that have waited to be indexed for less than one hour.
5. **In Queue between 1h and 2hrs** (Na fila entre 1 e 2 horas): Number and percentage of products that have waited to be indexed between one and two hours.
6. **In Queue between 2hrs and 4hrs** (Na fila de 2 a 4 horas): Number and percentage of products that have waited to be indexed between two and four hours.
7. **Not Indexed** (Produtos que não foram indexados): Number and percentage of products that were not indexed at the end of the process.
8. **Total**: Total of active products that could have been indexed.

## Estimated indexing time 
The indexing time of a product is estimated based on the recent history of its process to be indexed. 

This information is on the top right corner of the report:

- **Indexing time = 3 min**
- **Time to index the last item**

This implies, for example, that the current estimate is that it takes up to 3 minutes for a product to be indexed. This means that I have 10 products to index, it takes a total of 3 minutes, and not by product, since in general they are indexed in parallel.
