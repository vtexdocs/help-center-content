>⚠️ There is a limit of 50 SKUs per product. To request an extension of the limit, please contact <a href= "https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests">our Support</a>.

For more information on each field, read their complete description below.

__Product Name:__ This field is already filled in with the SKU product name.

__Name:__ The SKU name, that is, the variation of the previously added product. Example: Product - Fridge, SKU - 110V. The SKU name is limited to 200 characters.

__Loyalty Value:__ Credit that the customer receives upon completing a purchase of 1 (one) specific SKU unit. If you enter "1" in this field, this means that the customer will get U$ 1 credit on the website.

__EAN/UPC:__ Unique SKU identification code (barcode). Up to 13 numerical characters.

__Reference Code:__ Unique reference code used internally for organizational purposes. Not mandatory.

__Shipping Weight:__ Shipping weight, which must have a value greater than zero to make the <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-proportional-shipping-costs-are-calculated--frequentlyAskedQuestions_155">proportional shipping cost</a> work properly.

>ℹ️ The **Inventory & Shipping/Shipping** module does not take units of measure into account in the fields below. It is only necessary to be consistent with what is registered in the SKU and in the [product registration fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/campos-de-cadastro-de-produto--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke).

__Shipping Height:__ Shipping height.

__Real Height:__ The real height of the product.

__Real Width:__ The real width of the product.

__Real Length:__ The real length of the product.

__Coming Soon (Expected on):__ To add the product for pre-sale, enter the estimated arrival date of the product, in the format dd/mm/yyyy. For the delivery date, you must consider both the launch date and the shipping estimation.

__Accessories:__ Adds SKUs to the SKU being added. If you are adding a dress, for example, you can add a belt as an accessory. This field generates a checkbox that the customer can click and buy both items.

__Suggestion:__ Suggests SKUs to the SKU being added. If you are adding a dress, a belt may be suggested. However, the customer cannot purchase them together, they will need to access each item page. 

__Similar (Alternate Products):__ This field shows other options of similar products on the product page. Maximum: 50 products.

__Show Together:__ Displays SKUs of products suggested to be bought together.

__Commercial Condition Code:__ Used to define SKU specific promotions/installment rules for SKUs. In case there is no specific condition, use the default value. To lern more, read our article on Commercial Conditions.

__Measurement Unit:__ Used only in cases where you need to convert the measurement unit for a sale, such as, for example, if a product is sold in boxes but customers want to buy per sqm (m²). In common cases, use "un".

__Unit Multiplier:__ Numerical unit that multiplies the selected quantity of the product when it is added to the cart. If the Multiplier is 5, the product will be added in multiple quantities of 5 - 5, 10, 15, 20, etc..

__Activate SKU if Possible:__ Activates the SKU if all activation requisites are met. Enable this field so that the SKU is automatically activated once the SKU registration is complete.

__SKU Activated?__ Defines whether an existing SKU is active or not. It is automatic and does not allow any changes, being used solely for consultation.

__Manufacturer Code:__ Code provided by the manufacturers to identify a product. If the product has a specific manufacturer code, this field must be filled in.

>❗ To ensure the items added to the inventory will be available for sale on the store, the [SKU ID](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-find-an-sku-id--4VQZsYeb3igGK2YowuEYWW) cannot contain **a leading zero**. For instance, the system does not read IDs with a `01`, `02`, `021` format because the expected format is `1`, `2`, `21`.
