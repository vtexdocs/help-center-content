In order to understand how to fill the registration form while creating a new product, see below the full description of the fields on this page, divided into two tabs: __Product__ and __Specifications__.

## Product

__Name:__ related to the product you are registering. Use simple words and avoid other languages or complex writing. This field is important for SEO and must respect the 150 character limit. Required field.

__Substitute words:__ synonyms of terms related to the name given to your department or category. "Television", for example, can have as a substitute word like "TV". This field is important to make your searches more comprehensive and must respect the 8000 character limit.

__TextLink:__ used to create the product URL. Required field. For more information, read [How is a product URL set up?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-is-a-product-url-set-up--frequentlyAskedQuestions_368).

>❗ When filling in the product’s **textLink**, avoid using the following reserved words, as this can hinder your store's performance and interfere with the functioning of VTEX Admin pages. See the list of reserved words below.
>
> *`a`
>
> *`meta`
>
> *`api`
>
> *`admin`
> 

__Page Title (Tag Title):__ text that is in the browser tab and corresponds to the title of the product page. This field is important for SEO.

__Product Description:__ description of the main information related to the product. A simple and easy to understand summary for the customer. To include line breaks and other formatting features in the product description, you must use HTML.

__Description (Meta Tag Description):__ brief description of the category. It's recommended that you don't exceed 150 characters so that the search engines can display it correctly in the results page.

__Brand__ enter or fetch the brand name then add it to the registration. For this to be possible, it's mandatory that the brand has already been registered and is active. Required field.

__Category:__ select the category to which the product belongs. For this to be possible, it's mandatory that the category in question has already been registered and is active. Required field.

__VTEX Global Category:__ it's a single category tree, already defined by the system, that will be used to integrate products with Google Shopping, Buscapé and marketplaces. Good mapping makes your store's products also found in partners more effectively.

__Trade policies:__ you must select the trade policies the product is intended for, in order to define the marketplaces where the product will be available. If no trade policy is selected, the product will be considered for all of them.

__Provider:__ enter or fetch the brand name to add it to the register.

__Market Launch date:__ field used to assist in the ordering of the search result of the site. Using the `O=OrderByReleaseDateDESC` querystring, you can pull this value and show the display order by release date. Also, you can use it to create auto-collection.

__Show on site:__ This feature enables or disables the visibility of a product in your store.

__Show out of stock:__ this feature causes a product, even when sold out, to appear in your store with the field in which the customer informs their email to be advised when the product is available again.

__Product Reference Code:__ unique combination of letters, numbers, or both for internal identification of the product in the store.

__Additional Description:__ Short description of the product. This information is rendered by the `$product.DescriptionShort` control and can be displayed on both the product page and the shelf.

__Tax Code:__ product identification number.

__Score (used for search order):__ value used to set the priority on the search result page. For more details about this field, read [How does the Score field work?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-does-the-score-field-work--1BUZC0mBYEEIUgeQYAKcae).

## Specifications

Depending on the category of the product created, fields may appear for you to complete in the __Specifications__ tab. These fields are properties that you can add to your SKUs to assign specific characteristics to the products in your store.

Here's how to [create your product specifications](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criando-um-campo-de-produto?locale=en).

If you have created any required product fields, the product can only be activated after this specification has been filled in.

>ℹ️ If your product does not appear on your store's website after you have created it, check out the article [Why is the product not shown on the website?](https://help.vtex.com/pt/faq/why-is-the-product-not-shown-on-the-website--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382) to understand how to solve this problem.
