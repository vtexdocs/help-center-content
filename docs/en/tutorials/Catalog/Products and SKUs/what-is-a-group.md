Group is the name given to a grouping of fields (specifications) related to a product or its SKUs. Whenever you register a product or SKU in your store, you can create fields
which may be grouped. The Group is at a hierarchical level above the field.

If you have a fashion store, for example, you can create the "Features" group to comprise the "Color" and "Size" fields. These fields are the specifications of your SKUs.
