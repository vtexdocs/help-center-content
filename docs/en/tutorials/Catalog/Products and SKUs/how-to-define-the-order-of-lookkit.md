The kit look is a product and SKU intended to group other SKUs. The difference between the kit look and a normal kit is that the kit look enables the separate purchase of its SKUs.

However, doubts arise regarding the order of these products on the product page. Currently, the order of the products follows the SKU id of the SKUs included in the kit.

That is, if the kit look includes the **6, 30, 14 and 10** SKUs, the ordering on the product page will be as follows:

- 6
- 10
- 14
- 30

A customized order can be created on the product page by using JavaScript.
