The VTEX platform enables us to work with “Cross Selling” and “Up Selling”, marketing techniques extensively used on the on-line retail market.

## What is Cross Selling?

This involves offering a supplementary product to the one the user is acquiring. For example, a visitor to your store is buying a cell phone, so he might be interested in earphones or a cover for the new device.

## What is Up Selling?

Up Selling means offering an upgrade for the product. Using the same cell phone as an example, you can offer a device with more functions or, if the device comes with earphones, you can offer a Bluetooth phone.

## Cross Selling and Up Selling on the VTEX platform

To help you use the above techniques, we can use the fields in the register of products /SKUs:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access the **Catalog** module.
2. Click on **All products** option.
3. In the list, identify the product you want and click on the name of the desired SKU.
4. Fill out the fields correctly as indicated below.
5. Click on the `Save` button.

**Acessories:** in this field we register the products that must be sold to complement another product. In this option, the products registered as accessories are shown as a purchase option by enabling the selection checkbox (function included in the layout).

**Suggestion:** This field is responsible for the Up Selling we learned previously; he we select the products that must be exhibited as suggestions; however, there is a rule for this to happen: the product will only be exhibited if the value of the suggestion is greater than the product we are looking at.

**Similar (Alternate products):** In this field, we select similar products we want to show the client at the time of purchase. However, there is no checkbox option as in the Acessories option.

**Show together:** Displays SKUs of suggested products for joint purchase.

The Up-Selling option can be also worked by using the benefit “[Buy Together](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/buy-together)”.
