Normally, the steps to exclude a product from a store would be the following:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Go to __All products__.
3. Search for the product you want.
4. In the line of the product, click on the arrow beside `Update`.
5. Click on `Delete`.

However, if the product in question has some link to another area of the system (which is quite common), you cannot delete it from the database.

In this case, the following error message will appear if you try to delete it:

The solution is to deactivate the product. See how to do this in the article [Deactivating store SKUs and products](/en/tutorial/deactivating-store-skus-and-products).
