# What to do before setting up product specifications

You first must have [Categories](/en/tutorial/registering-a-category) registered in your store. 
Then it's needed to register the structure of [Field Groups](/en/tutorial/creating-category-groups) and the [Product Fields](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-a-product-field) desired, in the categories administration screen. 

Once this structuring has been done on Categories and the products have been indexed, the fields will be available in the produts registration form.

Now, to set the specifications that each products will have, simply access the desired product and set it up.

# Setting up product specifications

1. Access **Catalog** module.
2. Access **Products and SKUs**
3. Access the product you want by clicking on **Update**
4. Access the tab **Specifications**
5. Fill in all requested fields and click on **Save**.  

**Attention!**Â In case a **mandatory** product field has been created, the product will only be enabled upon filing out this specification.
