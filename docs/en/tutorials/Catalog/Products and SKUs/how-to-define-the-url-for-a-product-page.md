The URL of a product page is the electronic address that allows accessing this page on the Internet. Creating a friendly and optimized URL is crucial to make it easily findable by search engines and simplify your customer's experience on your ecommerce website.

The VTEX URL structure for a product page is composed of the store domain plus the value of the required **textLink** field when [adding a product](/en/tutorial/adding-products--tutorials_2567), plus `/p`, which stands for "product."  For example: If the textLink field for a given product is populated with `polo-shirt` in a store with the domain `storename.com`, the URL's final structure will be `storename.com/polo-shirt`.

You can change the **textLink** of existing products anytime in the VTEX Admin, under **Catalog > All products > Edit**. We recommend filling in the field **textLink** with the product's name, using only the main keywords related to it.

Check out the [Filling rules](#filling-rules) section to understand the restrictions on this field.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>You can also change a product's page URL using the <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/catalog-api#overview">Catalog API</a>. In this case, you must change the field <code>LinkId</code>. See <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/catalog-api-put-product">Update Product</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

## Filling rules

Follow the rules below to fill in the **textLink** field:

- Replace spaces with hyphens (`-`).
- Use no more than 255 characters (preferably use up to 50).
- Do not use special characters like `_ ! . * ' ( ) ; : @ & = + $ , / ? % # [ ] |` or accents such as `´ ¨ ^ ~`.
- Do not use the following keywords since they are used for other features on the VTEX platform and may generate errors if applied to a product page's URL:
    * `a`
    * `meta`
    * `api`
    * `admin`

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <p>Please note that not complying with the rules listed above to complete the <strong>textLink</strong> field can affect your store's performance, lead to search issues, and interfere with the proper functioning of pages defined in the VTEX Admin.</p>
