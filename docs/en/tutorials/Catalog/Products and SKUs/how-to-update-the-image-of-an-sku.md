There are two ways to update SKU images: using the VTEX Admin or Catalog API.

>❗ You must perform this procedure very carefully. The procedure described below involves *deleting all images* of an SKU, which will make it **INACTIVE**. Please pay close attention to the recommendations in the steps below so that the image is successfully updated.

Since this procedure involves deleting all images from an SKU, consequently making it inactive, we recommend performing the image replacement process in small batches of SKUs.

## Via VTEX Admin

### Deleting images

1. Access the __Catalog__ module.
2. Click on __Products and SKUs__.
3. Select the SKU you want to change.
4. Click on the __Images__ tab.
5. Choose the images you want to delete and click __Remove__.

>❗ We recommend doing these image updates in small batches. Remember that deleting all images of an SKU inactivates it.

### Uploading new images

1. On the same screen, click __Insert__.
2. Choose the image on your computer.
3. Fill in the __Text__ and __Label__ fields.
4. Click __Send__.

### Activating the SKU

1. On the __SKU__ tab, check the box next to __Activate SKU if possible__.
2. Click __Save__.

Your product will now enter the [Indexing Queue](/en/tutorial/understanding-how-indexation-works). After being indexed, the SKU will be displayed with the new images.

## Via API

Use the [Update SKU File](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/catalog-api-sku-file#catalog-api-put-sku-file) endpoint.
