You may consult the log of when and who reindexed the base using the Full Clean Up tool, accessible through the following URL:

`https://{AccountName}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/admin/Site/fullcleanup.aspx`

In fact, any action taken on Full Clean Up is recorded on this page.

![fullcleanupLog](https://images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/4imYxqJjWwog0UYwCIcWY4/a036d799b6de9d34a2e2f810f3780929/fullcleanupLog.png)

The log displays the following information for each action:
- __Data__: date and time of action.
- __Nome__: email of the user who requested the change (only the Sponsor user is allowed to perform Full Clean Up actions).
- __Tipo__: shows the type of action taken.
- __Mensagem__: indicates specifically what action was taken.
