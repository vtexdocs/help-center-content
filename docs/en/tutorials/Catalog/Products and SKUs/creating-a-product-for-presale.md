On the VTEX platform, store operators can set the expected arrival date of a product and offer it in presale mode. Presale allows reserving products upon payment prior to the actual launch date and market availability.

In this article we will cover the following topics:

- [Scheduling prices](#scheduling-prices)
- [Scheduling content](#scheduling-content)

## Creating a product for presale

To make a product available on presale, follow the steps below.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click the **All products** page.
3. Click  `Add Product`.
4. In the **Market launch date** field put the intended launch date of the product in the `dd/mm/yyyy` format. This field is a criterion for sorting products in the store. To learn more about sorting products, read the article [Can I put my products in an order which I choose?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/can-i-put-my-products-in-an-order-which-i-choose--qfWKX2ZekoEoayiyo0uuA).
5. Fill in the [remaining product fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/product-registration-fields--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke)
6. Click `Save and add a new SKU`.
7. On the SKU creation page, fill in the **Coming soon expected on** field with the date when the product will be available for delivery by the store in the `dd/mm/yyyy` format.
>ℹ️ You need to consider both the launch date and the shipping cost to determine the arrival date: `final delivery time = delivery SLA + supply batch delivery time frame`
8. Fill in the [remaining SKU fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/sku-registration-fields--21DDItuEQc6mseiW8EakcY).
9. Click `Save` to finish.

>ℹ️ The presale item order should only be invoiced on or after the launch date, that is, when the product will be actually available in the inventory.

## Scheduling prices
To schedule your store's fixed prices for the presale of a product, follow the steps described in the article [Scheduling prices](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/scheduling-prices--4vVha6TGzYkguWuMOqCcCk).  

## Scheduling content
It is important to optimize the promotion of the product that will be launched to increase customer reach. Creating content for a new product increases the presale success rates.

To schedule content, follow the steps described in the [Scheduling content](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/scheduling-features-for-special-events--2nd50tPWdKK4waXRZLg0JI#scheduling-content) section of the [Scheduling for special events](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/scheduling-features-for-special-events--2nd50tPWdKK4waXRZLg0JI) article.
