First, let's make clear what the acronym SKU means. From the English *Stock Keeping Unit*, it is the physical unit of the product. This means that __the SKU is the variation of the product__. It contains the characteristics that make it a specific type of product.

If your store has a Shirt product, its SKUs might be __Blue Shirt__, __Red Shirt__, and __White Shirt__. Another way to classify your SKUs could be: Blue Shirt S, Red Shirt L and White Shirt XL.

In the Catalog hierarchy, the SKU is just below the product.

Structurally, first you define the product information and then you create your SKUs.
