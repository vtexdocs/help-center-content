SKU service is a VTEX feature that allows adding an item, that is optional and priced, to complement a product. For more information, read our article [What is a Service?](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-service--46Ha8CEEQoC6Y40i6akG0y).

In this article we will cover the following topics:

## Creating a service type
To register a service type, please follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.

3. Click on the **Service types** tab.

## Creating a service value and associating it with a service type
After registering the service type, you must assign a value to it. To register the value of a service type, please follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on **Custom Product Attributes**.
3. Click on the **Service values** tab.

- **Cost:** the cost of the service to the store.
- **Service type:** option to link the service value to the service type.

## Linking a service to a SKU
After creating the service, you must link it to the desired SKUs. You can link a service to more than one SKU.

To link a service to a SKU, please follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on **Custom Product Attributes**.
3. Click on the **Link service values to SKU** tab.

9. Select the updated CSV template.
10. Click on the button `Link service values to SKU`.

### Template fields
Use the template carefully, always making sure that the information is correctly filled in. In order to avoid errors, all fields in the template must be filled in.

>⚠️ When filling the spreadsheet, do not change or delete the column headings in row 1. Fill in the desired values in the rows after the column headings for the import to work correctly.  

- **Nome Serviço:** name of the service.
- **Texto Serviço:** text that will be displayed along with the service.
- **Id SKU:** identifier number of the SKU that is being associated with the service.
- **Nome SKU:** name of the SKU that is being associated with the service.
- **Id Serviço Tipo:** identifier number of the service type. To find out the ID of the service type, please refer to the **Id** field in the **Service types** tab.
- **Nome Serviço Tipo:** name of the service type.
- **Id Serviço Valor:** identifier number of the service value. To find out the ID of the service value, please refer to the `IdSkuServicoValor` field in the URL of the desired service value. In the example below, the service value ID is 3:

  `https://{accountName}.myvtex.com/admin/Site/SkuServicoValorForm.aspx?IdSkuServicoValor=3`

- **Nome Serviço Valor:** name of the service value.
- **Valor:** how much the customer will be charged for the service.
- **Custo:** the cost of the service to the store.
- **Ativo:** status of the service. Enter `1` to keep the service active and `0` to keep it inactive.
