## What to do before loading the SKU specifications

You first must have [Categories](/en/tutorial/registering-a-category) registered in your store. 
Then it's needed to register the structure of [Field Groups](/en/tutorial/creating-category-groups) and the [SKU Fields](/en/tutorial/creating-sku-fields) desired, in the categories administration screen. 

Once this structuring has been done on Categories and the SKUs have been indexed, the fields will be available in the SKU registration form.

Now, to set the specifications that each SKUs will have, simply access the SKU and set it up.

## Setting SKU specifications

1. From the Admin menu, click __Catalog__.
2. Access __Products and SKUs__.
3. Enter the SKU you want to change.
4. Access the __Specifications__ tab.
5. Fill in all requested fields and click on **Save**. 

**Attention!**Â In case a **mandatory** product field has been created, the product will only be enabled upon filing out this specification.
