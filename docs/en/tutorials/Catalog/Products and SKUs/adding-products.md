Product registration can be done through VTEX Admin, spreadsheet or ERP. Before creating a product, it is recommended that you have already created a Brand and Category for it.

### VTEX Admin

Follow the step by step to add your products using VTEX Admin:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __All products__.
3. Click  on `Add Product`.
4. Fill in the [fields for product registration](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/product-registration-fields--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke).
5. To finish, click `Save`.
6. If you want to register your SKUs then click `Save and add new SKU`.

### Spreadsheet 

Follow the step by step to create your products using a spreadsheet:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __Import and Export__.
3. Click on __Export/Import__.
4. Click on the __Import__ tab. You can download the spreadsheet to check or change your products;
5. Fill in the [spreadsheet fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/filling-in-fields-in-the-import-spreadsheet--4nYhx63Q5yokQWaMguaIgI).
6. Go back to the VTEX Admin and upload the file with the `.xls` extension.
7. Click on `Import`.

Depending on the quantity of products, their processing can be time consuming. After it ends, you will receive the import confirmation in your email.
