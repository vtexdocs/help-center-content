This article aims to outline some good practices regarding the use of the images of your products. In order to get good results with your images and solve possible import problems, follow the suggestions below:

- The name of the image files should not contain spaces. If necessary, we recommend that the characters be hyphenated.
- Do not use special characters in the image names. Follow an alphanumeric pattern.
- The recommended file extension is .JPG (not .JPEG).
- We recommend that your images have a white background.
- The format of the images should preferably be square, to avoid distortions.
- Images must not be less than 600 pixels.
- Images can be up to 3200 x 3200 pixels.
- For image zooming to work correctly, we recommend that the images have a size of at least 1000 pixels. If possible, you can achieve an even better zoom result with images from 1500 to 2000 pixels.
- We recommend that the images are not more than 300 kb in size.
- We do not recommend stretching the image so it does not affect its quality.
