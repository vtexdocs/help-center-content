> ⚠️ The **List** feature is exclusive to stores that use Legacy CMS Portal.

Lists are groupings of products that you can make available in your store to your customers. They can be of various types and be associated with events such as wedding, bridal shower, anniversary or any other type of list that your consumer may want to create.

The main purpose of shopping lists is to __group all products of interest to a customer in one place__. With that you give them access to their selected products. They just need to use their login and password. When a list is created, your client can share it with friends, family, or anyone else who may want to give them presents.
