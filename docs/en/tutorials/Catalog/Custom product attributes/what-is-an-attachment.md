An attachment is the optional and cost-free customization of a product. It's used to add information to an SKU. This information may be related to a [service](/en/tutorial/what-is-a-service) or the purchased item itself.

<div class = "alert alert-warning">
VTEX does not control the stock of an attachment. This is a responsibility of the marketplace or the seller.
</div>

If your purchased item is a Brazilian National Team Shirt, the name of your Attachment may be __Customization__, and its keys:

- Name: which allows the inclusion of the customer's name, with up to 20 characters, on the back of the shirt.
- Number: which allows the inclusion of a number chosen by the client in the back of the shirt, among the values 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11.
