In case of recurring queries, the XML is updated approximately every 2 hours.

This query means that the XML was called in less than 48 hours. Those XMLs not called in the last 48 hours are not updated until a new call is made. This is done to keep up to date only the XMLs used.

You can view the date of the latest XML update. This information is shown in UTC time at the foot of the document, as illustrated below.

>ℹ️ If the option “Display SKUs without available stock (out of stock) in Inventory among the results” is not checked, out-of-stock products/SKUs will NOT be shown in the XML. Inactive products also do **not** appear in the XML.
