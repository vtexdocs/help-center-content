When the user has a giftlist (wedding list, gift list), the previous callcenter toolbar would bring the IDs for these lists, taking directly to the list management area. This feature is no longer available.

The giftlists can still be acessed from the “gerenciar lista” menu, that must be made available to your customers in your store through the URL ending with ”/giftlist/manage”.
