The **Catalog** menu contains the features related to the product assortment of your ecommerce store. In order for your customer to see the products on the website, you need to add them to this Admin menu first. The architecture of the VTEX Catalog is based on four fundamental concepts:

- **Category:** generic divisions of the items available in the store.  
- **Product:** generic definition of the services available in the store, which are offered in the store window.  
-	**Variation:** variation of a product, that is, the physical item of a product in stock.  
-	**Specifications:** product properties that define the specific characteristics of the variations.  

The **Catalog** menu in your redesigned Admin brings together the pages where you manage your ecommerce catalog, pricing, and inventory.

Check out the menu’s different sections and pages below.
