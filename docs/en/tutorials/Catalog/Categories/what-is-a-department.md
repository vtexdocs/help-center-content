The Department is the first level of categorization for your store. Departments are sections or sectors that classify the areas of your business. When classifying or organizing your e-commerce, it's recommended that you present your products through the following hierarchical levels: Department, Category and Subcategory.

In order to optimize the usability of your store, we recommend that you create a maximum of three levels. If you have a fashion store, for example, it might have the following structure:

__Female__ (Department)


__Acessories__ (Category)


__Shoes__ (Subcategory)


In such way, you make life easier for users and ensure they quickly find the products they are looking for.
