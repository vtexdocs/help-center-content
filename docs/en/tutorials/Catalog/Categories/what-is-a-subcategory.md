The Subcategory is the third level of categorization for your store, below Department and Category levels. 

These are forms of classification or organization to present the products of your store. When creating an e-commerce it's recommended that you have subcategories, below categories, to make life easier for users, ensuring that they quickly find the products they are looking for.

Subcategories are organized by hierarchical levels, such as a family, so the Parent category (category) is above the Child categories (subcategories), but is still part of the same family.

While creating subcategories for your store, think about the structure of what you sell. If you have a furniture store, you can have the categories Sofa, Bed and Bookcase, and the following subcategories:

__Sofa (Father) __

2 places (Child)

3 places (Child)

4 places (Child)

---

__Bed (Father) __

Single (Child)

Couple (Child)

Queen (Child)

King (Child)

---

__Bookcase (Father) __

2 shelves (Child)

3 shelves (Child)

4 shelves (Child)

5 shelves (Child)

Having an organized and clear structure is an important part of product mapping, marketing strategy and therefore the success of your e-commerce.
