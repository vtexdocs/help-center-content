<div class = "alert alert-info">
On the VTEX platform, Department, Category, and Subcategory structure is not predefined. It varies according to the structure of your store, and it is not mandatory to create these 3 hierarchical levels.
</div>

The registration of a category happens inside the __Catalog__ on VTEX Admin.

Follow the instructions below to create a category:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Catalog__, or type __Catalog__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click  __Categories__.
4. Click the first level of the category.
5. Click `Actions`.
6. Click `Include`.
7. Fill up the fields, described below.
8. Click `Save`.

## Filling in the category registration fields

To better understand the meaning of each category registration field, see the full description below.

- __Name:__ the name you want to give to the department or category you're registering. Use simple words and avoid other languages or complex writing. This field is important for SEO and must respect the 150 character limit.

  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <p>When filling in the category <b>Name</b>, avoid using the following reserved words, as this can hinder your store's performance and interfere with the functioning of VTEX Admin pages. See the list of reserved words below.
    <ul>
      <li><code>a</code></li>
      <li><code>meta</code></li>
      <li><code>api</code></li>
      <li><code>admin</code></li>
    </ul></p>
  </div>

- __Similar words:__ synonyms of terms related to the name given to your department or category. "Television", for example, can have as a substitute word like "TV". This field is important to make your searches more comprehensive and must respect the 200 character limit.
- __Category Page Title (Tag Title):__ text that is displayed in the browser tab and corresponds to the page title of the category. This field is important for SEO search engines. It only supports plain text and cannot contain HTML tags.
- __Category Description (Meta Tag Description):__ brief description of the category. It's recommended that you don't exceed 150 characters so that search engines can display it correctly in the result pages. This field only supports plain text and cannot contain HTML tags.
- __AdWords Remarketing Code:__ code used for Google Adwords campaign.
- __Lomadee Campaign Code:__ code used by Buscapé campaigns.
- __Parent Category:__ if the registered category is a child one category, that is, a subcategory or a category inside a department, this field must inform the parent category to which it belongs.
