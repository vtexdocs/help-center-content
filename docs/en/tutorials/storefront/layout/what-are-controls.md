Controls are code snippets that you can use in the templates of your web site to perform specific actions. At VTEX, you'll find a number of native controls to render various features.

For example, by using the `<vtex.cmc:productName/>` control on a product page, the system will provide the product name to be displayed on the screen.

You can check all available native controls and their respective uses [in this article](/en/tutorial/list-of-controls-for-templates).
