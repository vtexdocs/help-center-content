The dataset consists of five tables that provide the most recent catalog information for a VTEX account. This dataset provides information on **products, SKUs, brands, categories** and **specifications.**

> ⚠️ In the Catalog data model, only **Brands** and **Categories** with at least one product or SKU linked in the catalog are eligible for submission, regardless of active status.

In this section you will find the following information:

- [Data characteristics](#data-characteristics)  
- [Table: product](#table-product)  
- [Table: SKU](#table-sku)  
- [Table: brand](#table-brand)  
- [Table: category](#table-category)  
- [Table: specification](#table-specification)  
- [Table: cluster](#table-cluster)  
- [Analysis with catalog data](#analysis-with-catalog-data)  
- [Correlations with other data](#correlation-with-other-data)

## Analyses with catalog

Some analysis options with catalog data are:

- **Verify a product's status:** use the "isActive" field to check if the Catalog module considers a product active.  
- **Identify related SKUs:** obtain a list of all SKUs linked to a parent product.  
- **Detail product specifications:** retrieve all specifications of a product, including its brand, category, and other relevant details.  

## Correlations with other data

Catalog data is strongly connected to various other data models. Here are some noteworthy correlations:  

- **Relationship with Inventory:** by integrating catalog data with inventory information, you can precisely determine the available stock for each product.  
- **Relationship with Orders:** combining catalog data with order details enables you to accurately analyze the number of orders associated with each product in your catalog.  
- **Impact on Conversion Rate:** evaluating navigation data to determine the store's funnel conversion rate helps you understand how each product plays a role in users' navigation behavior.
