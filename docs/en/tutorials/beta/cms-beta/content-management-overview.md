The Content Management System (CMS) provides merchants with the flexibility and control needed to manage and structure their storefront content independently. It allows business teams and content editors to create multiple versions of content, collaborate on details, review for quality, and schedule publishing. To access the CMS, open the VTEX Admin and go to **Storefront > Content > Content**.

Below are the main parts of the CMS:

## Content

**Content** is the main dashboard of the Content Management system. It allows you to list and manage all your store’s digital content, including pages, layouts, templates, and global sections, within the VTEX Admin. This central hub aims to streamline the content creation, editing, and publishing process through a modular system with version control (branches).

For more details, refer to the [Content](/TBD) guide.

## Stores

The Stores page displays each storefront linked to the account's CMS, allowing you to manage them. On the Stores page, you can:

* View all Stores for the account and see which storefronts they are connected to.  
* Add new Stores to link additional storefronts or projects to the CMS.  
* Open a Store’s settings to manage its preview/build URLs, repository integration, and default and fallback locales for content delivery.

For more details, refer to the [Stores](/TBD) guide.

## Branches

Branches provide a collaborative workspace where teams can work on content changes in an isolated environment before merging them into the Main branch and without impacting what is live on the storefront.

Each branch is an isolated version of your content, allowing multiple editors to create, update, and refine pages, layouts, and sections at the same time. All changes are tracked per content item, making it easy to see who changed what and when.

The collaboration flow in a branch is:

* **Edit:** Multiple editors work in the same branch, making content updates independently.  
* **Track:** Every change is versioned, with clear visibility into who made each update and when.  
* **Preview:** Teams preview unpublished changes in a storefront context to review and validate content.  
* **Merge:** Once approved, the branch is merged into the Main branch, publishing all changes to the live store.

For more details, refer to the [Branches](/TBD) guide.

## Media

Media is responsible for managing your store's media files, such as images and videos. For images, you can upload and organize files up to 5 MB in the following formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, and WebP. For videos, you can add a URL to an externally hosted video provider, such as YouTube.

For more details, refer to the [Media](https://help.vtex.com/docs/tutorials/media-overview) guide.
