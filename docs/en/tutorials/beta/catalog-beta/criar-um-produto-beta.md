> ℹ️ This feature is currently in beta, which means we are working on improving it. If you have any questions, please contact our [Support team](https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests).

The **Add Product (Beta)** page allows you to create and edit[ products](/en/tracks/catalogo-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/1wmX3QvQVxbKVmalhIE5Ru) and their corresponding [SKUs](/en/tracks/catalogo-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3mJbIqMlz6oKDmyZ2bKJoA) in the VTEX Admin. To add a new product, follow the steps below.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Products & SKUs**, or type **Products & SKUs** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click `+ Add Product`.
3. Determine if the product being created will be active in the store. To create the product as active in the store, select the **Active** &lt;i class="fas fa-toggle-on">&lt;/i> option in the top right corner of the page.
If you want to create a product as inactive, click the <i class="fas fa-toggle-on"></i> button and note that the option will change to **Inactive**. You can activate it later from the product edit page or the product list.
4. Complete the information in each tab as detailed below.
