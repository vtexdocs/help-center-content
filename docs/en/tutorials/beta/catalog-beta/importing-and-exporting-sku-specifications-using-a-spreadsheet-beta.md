> ℹ️ This feature is in beta, which means that we are working to improve it. If you have any questions, please contact our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).

In VTEX Admin, you can manage SKU specification import and export using a spreadsheet, as described in the sections below:

- [Importing SKU specifications using a spreadsheet](#importing-sku-specifications-using-a-spreadsheet)
- [Exporting SKU specifications using a spreadsheet](#exporting-sku-specifications-using-a-spreadsheet)
- [SKU specification spreadsheet fields](#sku-specification-spreadsheet-fields)

## Importing SKU specifications using a spreadsheet

To import SKU specifications using a spreadsheet, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Products and SKUs**, or type [Products and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. At the top of the page, click `Import`.
3. Click `SKU specifications`.
4. Add the spreadsheet with an `.xls` or `.xlsx` extension. You can drag and drop the file onto the designated area, or click the window to select the file locally.

  > ⚠️ To get an import template, [export the SKU specifications](#exporting-sku-specifications-using-a-spreadsheet).

5. Once the file is uploaded, click `Import`.

  > ❗ The import time will depend on the size of the data being processed. Leaving the page won't interrupt the operation.

While the operation is running, a message will display indicating that the file is being processed. After the import is complete, the page will display "SKU specifications imported successfully" and you'll receive a confirmation email.

## Exporting SKU specifications using a spreadsheet

To export an `.xlsx` file with the SKU specification information, follow these steps:

> ℹ️ The exported information corresponds to the fields described in the SKU specification spreadsheet fields section.

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Products and SKUs**, or type [Products and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. (Optional) If you want to export the SKU specifications of certain items, apply a [search](/en/tutorial/products-and-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By#searching-for-a-product) or a [filter](/en/tutorial/products-and-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By#filtering-products) as desired. This step isn't required when exporting all the SKU specifications in the catalog.
3. At the top of the page, click `Export`.
4. Click `SKU specifications`.

While the operation is running, a message will display indicating that the file is being processed. Leaving the page won't interrupt the operation. You can [track the export progress in the window](/en/tutorial/importing-and-exporting-products-and-skus-using-a-spreadsheet-beta--5udKxWP1ZeBD7QB7Fy2BNl#tracking-export-process) that opens on the page. 

Once the export is complete, you'll receive an email with a link to download the file. The download link is valid for 24 hours. After that, the link expires. You can also download the file from the window that opens on the page.
