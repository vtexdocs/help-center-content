In the VTEX Admin, you can manage SKU specification import and export using a spreadsheet, as described in the sections below:

- [Import products and SKUs using a spreadsheet](#importing-products-and-skus-using-a-spreadsheet)
- [Export products and SKUs using a spreadsheet](#exporting-products-and-skus-using-a-spreadsheet)
- [Track export process](#tracking-export-process)

> ℹ️ To learn how to manage your products and SKUs manually in the VTEX Admin, see the following articles: [Adding or editing products](/en/tutorial/adding-or-editing-products--29IkdEu6GofCFlltsZh2H8) and [Adding or editing SKUs](/en/tutorial/adding-or-editing-skus--4ryZ6J45kwn3jDiQBxGiiN). For information about [backend integrations with ERP](/en/tracks/trilha-da-loja-vtex--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/7euXDZR5CCnVFSrXyczIhu), see the [Back office integration guide (ERP/PIM/WMS)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/erp-integration-guide).

## Importing products and SKUs using a spreadsheet

To import products and SKUs using a spreadsheet, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Products and SKUs**, or type [Products and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. At the top of the page, click `Import`.
3. Click `Products and SKUs`.
4. In the window that opens, click **Download the import spreadsheet template here** to get the file.
5. Complete the spreadsheet details as described in the section [Product specification spreadsheet fields](#product-specification-spreadsheet-fields).
6. Add a spreadsheet with the `.xls` or `.xlsx` extension. You can drag and drop the file into the upload area, or click the window and select the file locally.
7. Click `Import`.

  > ❗ Processing time depends on the amount of data being processed. Leaving the page won't interrupt the operation.

While the operation is in progress, a message appears indicating that the file is being processed. After the import is complete, the page will display "Products and SKUs imported successfully" and you'll receive a confirmation email.

## Exporting products and SKUs using a spreadsheet

To export a `.xlsx` file with product and SKU information, follow these steps:

> ℹ️ The exported information corresponds to the fields detailed in the section [Product specification spreadsheet fields](#product-specification-spreadsheet-fields).

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Products and SKUs**, or type [Products and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. (Optional) If you want to export a subset of products and SKUs, [search](/en/tutorial/products-and-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By#searching-for-a-product) or a [filter](/en/tutorial/products-and-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By#filtering-products) the desired items. This step is not required to export all products and/or SKUs.
3. At the top of the page, click `Export`.
4. Click `Products and SKUs`.
5. In the **Export** modal, select the checkboxes for **Product fields** and/or **SKU fields** as desired. Required fields can't be unchecked.

  > ⚠️ Only spreadsheets exported with all fields can be imported later.

6. Click `Export`.

While the export is in progress, a message will appear indicating that the file is being processed. Leaving the page won't interrupt the operation. You can track progress in the export window on the page, as shown in the next section.

Once the export is complete, you'll receive an email with a link to download the file. The download link is valid for 24 hours. After that, the link expires. You can also download the file from the window that opens on the page.

## Tracking export process

While the export is being processed, the [Products and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) page will display a window at the bottom, as in the following image:
