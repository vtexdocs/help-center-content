> ℹ️ This feature is in beta, which means that we are working to improve it. If you have any questions, please contact our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).

In VTEX Admin, you can manage the import and export of image information using a spreadsheet, as detailed in the following sections:

- [Importing product and SKU images using a spreadsheet](#importing-product-and-sku-images-using-a-spreadsheet)
- [Exporting product and SKU images using a spreadsheet](#exporting-product-and-sku-images-using-a-spreadsheet)
- [Product and SKU image spreadsheet fields](#product-and-sku-image-spreadsheet-fields)

## Importing product and SKU images using a spreadsheet

To import product and SKU images using a spreadsheet, follow these steps:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Product and SKUs**, or type [Product and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. At the top of the page, click `Import`.
3. Click `Images`.
4. In the window that opens, click **Download template** to get the file.
5. Complete the spreadsheet details as described in the section [Product and SKU image spreadsheet fields](#product-and-sku-image-spreadsheet-fields).
6. Add the spreadsheet with an `.xls` or `.xlsx` extension. You can drag and drop the file onto the designated area, or click the window to select the file locally.
7. Click `Import`.

While the import is in progress, a message will be displayed indicating that the file is being processed. Leaving the page won't interrupt the operation. After the operation is complete, you will receive a confirmation email.

> ⚠️ Products with images successfully imported are automatically queued for [indexing](/en/tutorial/entendendo-o-funcionamento-da-indexacao--tutorials_256). If this doesn't happen, see the article [Why is the product not visible on the website?](/en/faq/por-que-o-produto-nao-aparece-no-site--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382).

## Exporting product and SKU images using a spreadsheet

To export a `.xlsx` file with the images from your catalog, follow these steps:

> ℹ️ The exported information corresponds to the fields detailed in the section [Product and SKU image spreadsheet fields](#product-and-sku-image-spreadsheet-fields).

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Catalog > Product and SKUs**, or type [Product and SKUs](/en/tutorial/produtos-e-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By) in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. (Optional) If you want to export the images of certain products and SKUs, [search](/en/tutorial/products-and-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By#searching-for-a-product) or a [filter](/en/tutorial/products-and-skus--2ig7TmROlirWirZjFWZ3By#filtering-products) the desired items. This step isn't required when exporting the images of all the items in your catalog.
3. At the top of the page, click `Export`.
4. Click `Images`.

While the export is in progress, a message will be displayed indicating that the file is being processed. Leaving the page won't interrupt the operation. You can [track the export progress in the window](/en/tutorial/importing-and-exporting-products-and-skus-using-a-spreadsheet-beta--5udKxWP1ZeBD7QB7Fy2BNl#tracking-export-process) displayed on the page.

After the export of product and SKU images is completed, you will receive an email with a link to download the file. The download link is valid for 24 hours. After that, the link expires. You can also download the file from the window that opens on the page.
