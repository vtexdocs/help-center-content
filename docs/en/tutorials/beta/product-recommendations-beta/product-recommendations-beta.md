## Prerequisites

To activate Product Recommendations, you must have a store implemented with [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework).

## Recommendation strategies

See below the five available recommendation strategies, implemented directly by the VTEX team.

### Homepage

* **Custom recommendations:** Items selected based on user browsing behavior.  
* **Best-selling:** Products with the highest sales volume in the store.  
* **Recently viewed:** Items previously viewed by the user.

### Product Details Page (PDP)

* **Similar products:** Recommendations based on the viewed item.  
* **Buy together:** Recommendations for products that are frequently bought together.

## Implementation

To request activation of the Product Recommendations feature in your store, open a ticket with [Commercial Support](/pt/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3KQWGgkPOwbFTPfBxL7YwZ), indicating which strategies you want to activate. The VTEX team will review the request and get in contact with you.
