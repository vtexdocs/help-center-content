>ℹ️ The **Affiliates Program** is an app that is only supported by [VTEX IO](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2) stores and is not available for stores that use [Legacy Portal CMS](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/1oN446gRGcR2s70RvBCAmj) or [Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0#vtex-headless-cms). Please visit the Affiliates Program app developer guide to install and configure the app on your VTEX store.

In the **Affiliates Program** app, an affiliate is someone who partners with your VTEX store to promote sales in exchange for a commission. The term is, therefore, different from the [usual concept of an affiliate at VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-afiliado--4bN3e1YarSEammk2yOeMc0). 

The **Affiliates Program** app generates a specific URL from your VTEX store to your [registered affiliates](#adding-an-affiliate). When the affiliate shares the URL with a customer who buys using the link, the affiliate gets a commission. 

The app creates two page groups after being installed in your VTEX environment:

- [Affiliate pages](#affiliate-pages)
- [VTEX Admin pages](#vtex-admin-pages)

### Affiliate Pages

The app creates three types of affiliate pages, available to them without any access to your store's VTEX Admin, as shown in the table below:

| **Type** | **URL** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Affiliate page | `{storeName.com}/affiliates/{affiliateSlug}` |
| Affiliate profile page | `{storeName.com}/affiliates/{affiliateSlug}/profile` |
| Registration form page | `{storeName.com}/affiliate/form` |

The **affiliate page** is the VTEX store URL that they will share with the customers. The following image shows an example:

![print_affiliates_url_en](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/63BnppaNSakcI7YJVX2mAV/6d0e53ff26c4f9c7f3d9fbd3cebf4db9/print_affiliates_url_en.png)

The **affiliate profile page** is an interface where the affiliate can track and manage their orders and commissions. The image below shows an example:

![affiliate_profile_page_en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/7kNS1iqcYLpB7roih4QdiF/9f11c3ffaa7aac74fe70ab6268679b74/print_profile_en.png)

The **registration page** allows those who are interested in becoming affiliates to fill in their information to apply for VTEX store registration. 

>ℹ️ The affiliate pages are customizable. Learn more in the [Affiliates Program app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/affiliates-program-app) developer's guide.

### VTEX Admin pages

The **Affiliates Program app** creates interfaces in the VTEX Admin for you to manage all affiliate-related content. 

After [installing](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/affiliates-program-app#installation) the app, the following pages become available in your VTEX Admin under **Other > Affiliates**: 

- [Affiliate Management](#affiliate-management)
- [Order Management](#order-management)
- [Commission Management](#commission-management)

If your store uses the [New VTEX Admin](https://content.vtex.com/join-new-admin-beta-program-en/), go to **Apps > Affiliates**. 

## Affiliate Management

The **Affiliate Management** page allows you to do the following:

- [Add an affiliate](#adding-an-affiliate)
- [Search for affiliates](#searching-for-affiliates)
- [Filter affiliates](#filtering-affiliates)
- [View affiliate details](#viewing-affiliate-details)
- [Edit an affiliate](#editing-an-affiliate)

![affiliates_management_page_en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/7E41Gki569BjcMFnhsttH9/6ea891b6bd27373375fb3d808b26d97c/affiliates_management_page_en.png)

In the app, the `Affiliate ID` is an alphanumeric code automatically generated when you create a new affiliate.

### Filtering affiliates

- [Search for orders](#searching-for-orders)
- [Filter orders](#filtering-orders)
- [Export order spreadsheet](#exporting-the-order-list)
- [View order details](#viewing-order-details)
