### VTEX App Store
Â 
You can access all of the apps available for installation at the link: `apps.vtex.com`, VTEX's new app marketplace.

### Installing an app

Following the flow of your app in the **VTEX App Store**, you are redirected to the app details page within the VTEX platform, in the new **Apps** module, responsible for installing, configuring and managing your apps.

To install the app you get, just click on the blue *install* button located on the upper right side.

#### Initial Settings

After installation, a yellow alert message may appear for some apps. This message is just to remind you that your app needs an initial setup to work correctly. Make sure that your app has all the configuration data filled in before you put it into production.

#### Publishing Your Test Workspace

Every App is installed in a test workspace, meaning that no changes made in this workspace affect your store in production, changes will only be reflected in your store if you actually publish that workspace.

Click the ** publish ** button, located in the upper fixed bar of your admin to publish the workspace.
