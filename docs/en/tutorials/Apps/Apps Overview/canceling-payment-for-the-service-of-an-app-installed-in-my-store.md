In order to cancel fees for a service belonging to an app, just __remove the app__ in VTEX admin.
To do this, follow the step below:

1. Access `{store-name}.myvtex.com/admin`.
2. In the side menu, click __Apps__.
3. Click __My Apps__.
4. Click __Settings__ of the desired app.
5. Click __Desinstall__.
6. Clique __Desinstall__ again to save your changes.

After following these steps, you will no longer be charged for the service used by the app.
