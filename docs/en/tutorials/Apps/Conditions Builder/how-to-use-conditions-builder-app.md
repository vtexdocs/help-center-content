## Installing
__Conditions Builder__ is an app available on App store.

1. Go to [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/).
2. Look for **Conditions Builder** app.
3. Click on "GET".
4. Fill the field with your account name.
5. Hit "Confirm order and begin installation".

## Using
After installing it, you can access it from the sidebar (installed apps section) or via the following link: 
`{{AccountName}}.myvtex.com/admin/conditions-builder.`

### Creating a condition

1. Click on "Create".
2. Choose a name for your condition - Your name can only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphen.
3. If you want your condition to be teasable* toggle the eye button until its blue.
4. (Optional) Write a short description. This is for internal control only and will not be visible to your customers.
5. Click on "Start Building".

After you hit the "Create button", you are going to see a workspace with a block list on the left side of the screen.  
Now you only have to drag the blocks onto the workspace and conect them, and finally creating your logic.

### Editing a condition

You can edit an existing condition at any time. You just need to click the condition you want to edit and start changing it. You can change the logic itself, but you can also change details about your condition, as description and visibility. Just make sure to hit save after changing it.

### Enabling/ Disabling a condition

If you want a condition to no longer be applied, you can simply disable it instead of deleting it, so if you later on decide to be applied you just enable it.

- When toggle button is blue -> it is enabled
- When toggle button is gray -> it is disabled
