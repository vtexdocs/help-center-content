In addition, with the new app you can perform version tests and update it whenever a new version is available, receiving continuous improvements and updates of new features.

To test the customizations on your page, you may work on a different workspace without affecting the production environment.

1. To create it, go to the [VTEX App Store](https://app.vtex.com).
2. Install the My Orders app.
3. View the new My Orders page.
4. Make the necessary changes to the new page.
5. Ready! Now you will see how your page will behave before you upload it.
6. To move My Orders to the production environment (where your customers can actually use it), you must publish the change. To do that, just click on the __Publish__ button.
