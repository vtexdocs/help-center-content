For international sales, it is necessary that the store is prepared to accept foreign documents and phone numbers, and to calculate the freight for the destination country, thereby accepting delivery addresses with ZIP codes from other countriesy.

The [Configuring global checkout](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/configure-the-global-checkout)Â tutorial will guide you through these settings.

Remember also to let available payment methods that accept international credit cards.

With that done, and paying attention to the legal issues, your store will be ready to start exporting.
