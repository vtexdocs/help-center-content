Cartman is a tool created to assist the merchant in the analysis of possible scenarios at Checkout, simulating, sharing and investigating carts in VTEX stores. By default, this tool is available and activated automatically for the following VTEX domains:

- `{accountname}.myvtex.com`
- `{accountname}.vtexcommercebeta.com`
- `{accountname}.vtexcommercestable.com`

For official store domains (`www.{yourstore}.com`), you need to [manually activate Cartman](configure-cartman#activate-cartman-manually).
