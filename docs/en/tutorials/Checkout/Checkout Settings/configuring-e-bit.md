[E-bit](http://www.ebit.com.br/ "E-bit") is a member of the Buscapé group of companies, and has been providing information on e-commerce in Brazil since 2000. E-bit uses a tool to measure consumer satisfaction about the quality of services provided by online stores.

E-bit currently operates as an online purchasing guide for consumer goods, rating virtual stores according to the quality of their services. The information is obtained from online reviews by consumers who have actually made purchases. E-bit will appear on every page of your site, thus giving it more credibility and serving as a differential for shoppers deciding on a purchase.

## How to start

- Create an account with [E-bit](https://company.ebit.com.br/cadastro-de-loja).
- Enter the company details on the site.
- After completion you will receive an email with some information on how to proceed with obtaining an E-bit seal.

## How to add the banners

The E-bit survey banner should be added ONLY on the store’s purchase completion page, where the customer’s order number is shown. The banner must always be placed in a prominent position, where the customer can see it easily. 

Check out the [E-bit documentation](https://ebit.com.br/developer/codigo-do-banner) for more information about adding the banners code to your site.

To access the footer of the purchase completion page, go to: [http://{accountName}.myvtex.com/admin/portal/#/sites/default/code/templates/checkout-confirmation-bottom](http://nomedaloja.myvtex.com.br/admin/portal/#/sites/default/code/templates/checkout-confirmation-bottom), where `{AccountName}` should be replaced by the name of your account.

## E-bit Medal

The E-bit medal should appear on the footer of all the pages of the store, including the purchase confirmation page. 

For more information about adding the code of the E-bit medal, visit the [E-bit documentation](https://ebit.com.br/developer/codigo-da-medalha).
