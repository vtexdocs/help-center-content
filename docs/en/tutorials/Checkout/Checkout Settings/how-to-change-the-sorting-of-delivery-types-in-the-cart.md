After the customer selects the desired products in the store and fills in or confirms their personal data, it is necessary to define the delivery method. Among the various options available, the cheapest shipping option will always be automatically shown to the customer at Checkout.

By clicking on the delivery types menu, the customer will be able to access other available options. These are sorted in ascending order, from fastest to slowest delivery.

This is a standard behavior of the platform, and if the merchant wants to modify it, it is possible to customize the cart (through CSS and JavaScript), according to the store's needs.

>⚠️ Note that you should be very careful about any CSS or JavaScript changes in your cart. If it's not properly done, this kind of customization can compromise the conversion rate of your store and the security of your checkout.
