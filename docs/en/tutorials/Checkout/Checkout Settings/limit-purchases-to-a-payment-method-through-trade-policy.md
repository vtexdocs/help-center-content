Since VTEX allows multiple Gateways, Acquirers and their corresponding association with payment means to be registered easily and quickly, some users may want to include promotions, or even partnerships, with an exclusive means of payment.

One way of segregating a payment condition is through sales policies.

For example, a storeowner wants to apply different prices for each UTM and to have the purchase made with a single, specific means of payment. It will be necessary to create a new commercial policy, and the UTM defined will have to load this policy on to the site. Setting up the payment condition with a specific commercial policy can be done in the connector itself, i.e. in the PCI.
