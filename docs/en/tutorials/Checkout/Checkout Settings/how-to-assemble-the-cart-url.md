In some situations, customers ask stores for the link to the shopping cart already assembled with all products. To mount the cart URL you need to use __/checkout/cart/add?__ at the end of the website's default URL, followed by these parameters:

- __Sales Policy:__ `sc={Sales Policy ID}`
- __SKU:__ `sku={SKU ID}`
- __Quantity:__ `qty={Quantity of the product}`
- __Seller:__ `seller={Seller ID}`

It's worth noting that it is only necessary to use the sales policy once in the URL. The other three parameters (SKU, Quantity and Seller) must be repeated every time a new product is added to the cart.

When you join each of them in the URL, you must separate them by "&". In the end, the URL looks like this:

`https://www.yourwebsite.com.br/checkout/cart/add?sc={Sales Policy ID}&sku={SKU ID}&qty={Quantity}&seller={Seller ID}`
Â 
See below two examples:
- With 1 product in the cart: `https://www.yourwebsite.com.br/checkout/cart/add?sc=1&sku=22&qty=1&seller=1`
- With 2 products in the cart: `https://www.yourwebsite.com.br/checkout/cart/add?sc=1&sku=22&qty=1&seller=1&sku=73&qty=3&seller=1`
