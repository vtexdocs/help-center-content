You can enable a __remarks field__ on the checkout page. Text entered in this field will be recorded on the order and may be used subsequently by the store. The text filled in this field will be registered in the order and can be used to add to any information that the store needs.

By default, this field will not be shown. For it to be shown, you must enter the following rule in the CSS:

`.note { display: block; }`

This field's content will be available via API, when an order is received, in the **openTextField** field.

And it will also be in the Message Center JSON, in the **openTextField** field**. This means that the field can be used in the store’s email template.
