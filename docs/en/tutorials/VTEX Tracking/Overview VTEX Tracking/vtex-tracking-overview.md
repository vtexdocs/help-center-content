- **Services:** in the VTEX Tracking context, Services are your business' pick ups, collections, or deliveries. In the web platform, you can add and manage all your operation's services.  

- **Routes:** they are the itinerary taken by the delivery drivers or delivery services partners, to deliver the service to the customer. In the web platform, you can configure different routes taken by the delivery drivers, and track future and past ones realized.  

- **Schedule:** the customer can schedule the best time to receive the service. If they cannot attend the period chosen initially, the delivery can be rescheduled. You can track schedules and manage them using the web platform.  

- **Route tracking:** You can track all details of routes taken by the delivery drivers or delivery services partners, through the web platform. Check out metrics that help in the service's supervision, such as deadline, status, time, estimated distance, and order details.  

- **Reports:** The Web Platform Reports module gathers data of scheduling, working hours, ranking, deliveries, SMS and email, and delivery drivers, or delivery services partners' status. Use this module to track and evaluate your operation with VTEX Tracking.    

## Mobile application

The VTEX Tracking mobile application is for the exclusive use of delivery drivers or delivery services partners. It has the following features:

- **Chat:** communication channel for the delivery drivers or delivery services partners to contact your business' support or third parties'. Via chat, you receive alerts about unforeseen events and delays, for example.  

- **Document digitization:** the mobile application allows digital signatures, a photo of the voucher and barcode scanning. Thus the delivery driver records receipts and reads product labels. It reduces your business' operational errors and ensures the quality of deliveries.  

- **Route Tracking:** the mobile application allows the tracking of the route taken via GPS. The delivery drivers or delivery services partners also check the delivery status or register if the delivery cannot be made.  

## Last Mile

Last Mile is the interface in which customers keep track of the delivery by email and SMS. It has the following features:  

- **Delivery Estimate:** via the Last Mile, the customer is notified about their delivery status in real-time, by SMS and email. It is possible to check the arrival time, driver information and route.    

- **Delivery Scheduling:** in case of any unforeseen event, the customer can reschedule the delivery using the Last Mile. This feature allows for cost reduction by eliminating multiple unsuccessful delivery attempts.  

- **Service Evaluation:**  the customer can evaluate the service at the end of each delivery, ensuring the steady improvement of your business.  

- **Delivery Attempts History:** the history of attempts is recorded when the delivery could not be completed at the first. It stores evidence on the reasons for not concluding the service, both from the delivery drivers, or delivery services partners, and the customer.
