VTEX Network is a portal that will catalog all the digital commerce services and solutions in the world.

It is currently being redesigned to offer VTEX partners extensions and consulting, training, financial, legal and technological services.

Our goal is to bring what Network was before (a system that interconnected sellers to VTEX marketplaces and vice versa) into the platform natively and with intuitive setup.

If you're looking for sellers and marketplaces and need their contacts, open a ticket to VTEX support. Our team will help you with this need until we have the native solution on VTEX platform.
