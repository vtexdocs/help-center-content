## Performance and security

In this section, you will learn about best practices to enhance the performance efficiency and security of your operation.

### Document your store architecture

Ecommerce operations often involve integrating different systems and technologies. Keeping the [store architecture](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/trilha-da-loja-vtex--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl#arquitetura-da-loja) documentation up-to-date is strategic for ensuring optimal performance from both the structure and the professionals involved.

The main benefits of creating and maintaining updated documentation of the operation architecture include:

* **Efficient implementation and maintenance:** It makes the initial phase of store development faster and future maintenance easier. Maintaining architecture documentation reduces reliance on experienced professionals and enhances collaboration between involved parties.
* **Easier evolution:** Documenting the store architecture minimizes the friction associated with changes, which contributes to the capacity of the business for innovation.
* **Well-informed decisions:** Understanding how the store works allows executive leaders to make informed decisions about infrastructure.
* **Quick action on security issues:** Addressing security issues or vulnerabilities is more efficient when architecture documentation is available.
* **Support optimization:** When support from our team or third parties is needed, sharing the architecture documentation streamlines communication between parties and increases the effectiveness of their efforts.

>ℹ️ For guidelines on documenting your store architecture, see the [Get started](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides) page on our Developer Portal and learn about the [interactive framework](https://assets.vtex.com/4524045/) of the VTEX platform.

### Follow security guidelines

There are strategies to prevent and reduce store exposure to the risk of malicious attacks. Some of the main ones are:

* **Anti-fraud systems:** Configure an [anti-fraud system](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-anti-fraud) for all store payment methods.
* **reCAPTCHA:** Use [reCAPTCHA](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/recaptcha-no-checkout--18Te3oDd7f4qcjKu9jhNzP#) to prevent fraud involving fake user accounts created by malicious software.
* **Authentication:** If your store has been experiencing recurrent attacks, consider disabling password login and opting for alternative [authentication](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-autenticacao--21CkKHLKP1o41lUpGhuRUs) methods for your customers.

>ℹ️ For more information about preventive actions, see the article [Best practices against virtual attacks](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/boas-praticas-contra-ataques-virtuais--191rpbF7UgrKapVCi1PCDE) and this [post](https://community.vtex.com/t/duvidas-frequentes-varias-tentativas-de-compras-fraudulentas-o-que-fazer/39470) on VTEX Community (available in Portuguese).

### Manage access permission levels

[VTEX store security](https://help.vtex.com/en/subcategory/seguranca-para-lojistas--6uJgdHqWf1Mo0rUfgxseTn) offers several preventive measures and [best practices](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/boas-praticas-para-evitar-golpes-que-utilizam-a-marca-da-vtex--6uPwUr2Fnj2m3TM4hAj2Ec) that can significantly enhance the security of your business. One of the main ones is managing access roles in your VTEX Admin.

Some key recommendations for VTEX [roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) are:

* **Grant minimal permissions:** Create roles considering the minimum level of permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks. Beyond the [predefined roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso), you can create [customized roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#criando-um-perfil-de-acesso). Limiting third-party access to critical content minimizes the risk of unwanted access, data leakage, or other harmful scenarios. 
* **Re-evaluate roles:** [Manage users](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciando-usuarios--tutorials_512) periodically and ensure that each has an appropriate level of permission. It is crucial to delete roles from employees or vendors who are no longer in your business. Proactively and regularly reviewing users help prevent security breaches caused by improper access.
* **Control app key permissions:** [App keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/chaves-de-aplicacao--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet) used in integrations can also access your VTEX store. Please follow our [Best practices for using application keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/boas-praticas-chaves-de-aplicacao--7b6nD1VMHa49aI5brlOvJm).
* **Restrict VTEX Admin access to corporate domains:** Using corporate domains adds a layer of security, preventing unauthorized access to your store. Limiting access to only use corporate email addresses mitigates the risk of data leaks (intentional or accidental), enhances protection against phishing, and improves the traceability of audit activities.
* **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):** [2FA](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/habilitar-login-por-autenticacao-de-2-fatores--4Ae1fcQi12g8u4SkQKCqWQ) adds an additional layer of security, protecting access to the store even if the secrecy of your password is compromised. This feature is particularly important for users with access to sensitive information and settings.

### Explore our certified marketplaces and partners

The VTEX platform architecture allows stores to act both as [marketplaces and sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402), and on [Marketplaces and Integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/marketplaces-e-integracoes--5AcBO1t29nhq7rBHas9b6V) they can discover and communicate with each other. In addition, VTEX offers native integrations with several [certified marketplaces](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-marketplace) and [partners](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-marketplaces-partners) (such as Amazon and Mercado Libre).
