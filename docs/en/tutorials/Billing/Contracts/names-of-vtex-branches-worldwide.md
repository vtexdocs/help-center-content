To know which country office you are invoiced from, consult your contract or [download your invoice](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-fazer-download-faturas-da-VTEX--tutorials_653). When you open an invoice, you will find the company name and address from which your store is being invoiced in the left corner of your invoice, below VTEX’s logo.
