<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><strong>This procedure applies only to VTEX's international offices.</strong></div>

To ensure the conformity of overseas payments, the following procedures must be followed:  

1)  Invoices received/issued after the 25th of each month will not be accepted. 

2) Payments are made by bank transfer or check depending on the case. All bank information must be detailed on the invoice. 

3) Payments will be made 60 days after the invoice approval, always on Wednesdays. It is fundamental that all complementary documentation is sent as well. 

**Example:**

- January 10th, 2020 - Invoice is approved within all acceptable documentation. 
- March 10th, 2020 - Payment would have been made on this date if it were a Wednesday. 
- March 11th, 2020 - Scheduled date for payment (extended date to Wednesday).

4) Every document must be sent by email to one of the emails listed below, according to the country of the expense. For invoice approval, copy in the responsible who assigned the task. 

| Country | E-mail | 
| ---------- | ---------- | 
| Argentina | arg-payables@vtex.com |
| Chile | chl-payables@vtex.com | 
| Colombia | col-payables@vtex.com | 
| Spain | esp-payables@vtex.com | 
| Italy | ita-payables@vtex.com | 
| Mexico | mex-payables@vtex.com |
| Romania | rou-payables@vtex.com |
| United Kingdom | uk-payables@vtex.com |
| United States | us-payables@vtex.com |
| Peru | per-payables@vtex.com |

5) For each service, payment is scheduled after the signed contract is received. 

6) For projects in which VTEX is the main contracted party and payments by clients are linked to project deliveries, project invoices must only be issued after VTEX has received payment from clients and such invoice issuance is then authorized by the Account Payables team.

Documents that are not in accordance with our process will be rejected and sent back for correction.
