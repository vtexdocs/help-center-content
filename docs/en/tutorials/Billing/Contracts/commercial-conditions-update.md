## Brazil

If you would like to understand if there are ways to improve the commercial conditions of your contract, you can contact Renewals Brazil at *renewals-br@vtex.com.br*.

Our renewals team will carry out an assessment with the client about the possibility of changing the plan considering the current price table and analyzing the company's plans for the coming years.

It is important to note that this can be done whenever the client deems it necessary, but it may be that your current contract is still the most suitable for your company's situation.
