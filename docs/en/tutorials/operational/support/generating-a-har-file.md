When looking for solutions to a complex problem, our Support team may need to receive additional information about the web requests generated in your browser while the problem occurs.

A useful feature for this is the requests log generated by the browser's developer tools. Through it you can generate a `.HAR` file, which contains detailed information about each request.

> ℹ️ To generate the `.HAR` file, we recommend using the Google Chrome browser due to its simplicity, but you can use other browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.

<br>

See the table below for the documentation with the file exporting instructions for each browser:

| **Browser** | **Documentation** |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Google Chrome (recommended) | Google: [Capture web session traffic](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10358597?hl=en&sjid=2751223489427809764-SA) |
| Mozilla Firefox, Safari or Microsoft Edge | Zendesk: [Generating a HAR file for troubleshooting](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828867098-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting) |

After exporting the `.HAR` file, you can send it to VTEX Support team. When using Google Chrome, make sure to configure the [exporting options with sensitive data](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-130#har).

> ❗ The `.HAR` file contains sensitive information about your store, so share it only with [VTEX Support team](/en/support).
