After resolving a ticket, the Support team sends an email to the user with a link to the **satisfaction survey**, so that they can evaluate the service received. This evaluation is completed within the VTEX environment.

Satisfaction surveys are available in the VTEX Admin, under **Apps > Installed Apps > Satisfaction Survey.** The page displays a search field to locate satisfaction surveys by ticket ID or subject and also provides access to the [Help Center](/en/) and [Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/).

Satisfaction surveys related to tickets are grouped into three categories:

- **Pending review:** Users have up to 27 business hours to review the service before the review expires. Weekends and bank holidays are not considered when calculating the deadline.
- **Reviewed:** Tickets that have already been reviewed by the user.
- **Expired:** Tickets for which the review period has expired.
