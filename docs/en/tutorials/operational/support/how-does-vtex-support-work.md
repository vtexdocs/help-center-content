At VTEX, we share responsibility for our customers' success. Our support plans allow you to receive the right level of attention and expertise to maximize the platform's potential and develop your business. This allows you to mitigate the risks of your digital operation and keep your operational costs under control.

## Support
 All customers have access to support from our team of experts, who are prepared to resolve tickets efficiently. Moreover, [Copilot](/en/tutorial/abrir-chamados-para-o-suporte-vtex--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM) is an integrated tool that helps answer questions and resolve technical issues. You can get support by opening a ticket through the Help Center or interacting directly with [Copilot](/en/tutorial/abrir-chamados-para-o-suporte-vtex--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM) in the VTEX Admin.

### Ticket system
Official communication with the Support team is via the ticket system. To open a ticket, click Support, located on the right side of the top bar on the [Help Center](/en/faq/planos-de-suporte--3kACEfni4m8Yxa1vnf2ebe#help-center) main page.

As soon as the client opens a ticket, it's forwarded to the support team assigned to the store, who will answer as quickly as possible. The client will receive ticket replies by email.

While your ticket is unresolved, you can track its status through the [support dashboard](https://vtexhelp.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/signin?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.vtex.com%2Fhc%2Fpt-br%2Frequests&theme=hc&locale=pt-br&brand_id=144968&auth_origin=144968%2Ctrue%2Ctrue). When a ticket is flagged as resolved, you'll receive an email to indicate your level of satisfaction and add any comments related to our service.

### Support Plans
VTEX Support is global and provides a standardized service experience for all customers, regardless of their region.  

Our teams follow the same global criteria for availability and service levels (SLA), ensuring consistency and predictability in support across all regions.

For more information, see [VTEX Global Support Resources](/en/tutorial/recursos-de-suporte-global-da-vtex--5maoEWCrTKFAEMXRsfcklV).

### Satisfaction Survey
The *Satisfaction Survey* page in your VTEX Admin allows you to view a list of resolved tickets submitted by you on behalf of your store. Through the page you can also rate VTEX's support through our Satisfaction Survey page after each ticket is resolved.    

To access it, go to **Account settings** and click on **Satisfaction survey**.

## Services available to any plan

### Real-time Monitoring
We value transparency regarding the integrity of our systems. Thus, whenever there is a critical problem that can affect store sales or the functioning of the platform, we will establish a proactive communication with clients and partners through the following channels:  

- The [Status](https://status.vtex.com/) page displays a timeline with the recent system incidents history. Detailed information on each incident is available, such as what happened, which modules were affected, the sequence of actions taken towards solving the problem, and in the end, a summary of the issue. 

We'll take all appropriate measures to resolve issues as soon as possible and guarantee compliance with the [SLA](/en/tutorial/o-que-e-o-sla-de-operacao-da-plataforma--2cIFrsY5S8usk84OU4QOKm) set in our contract.

### Help Center
In this [documentation portal for users](https://help.vtex.com/), you'll find tutorials for beginners, reference guides, and troubleshooting articles. This knowledge base contains all the information you need to use the VTEX Admin.

### Developer Portal
In this [portal for developers](https://developers.vtex.com/), you'll find all the documentation on integrations with APIs and development guides for your store. The content on this site is primarily intended for our [partners](https://vtex.com/br-pt/partner/) and our clients' team of developers.

### Announcements
In the Admin, we provide a product update notification channel, where we publish notifications whenever a new feature is released or an action is required to prevent a service interruption. These announcements are also available in the [News](/en/announcements) section of the Help Center.

Technical updates for developers and partners are published in the [Release Notes](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes) section of the Developer Portal. This includes API updates, new development guides, and announcements about VTEX IO.

Releases with greater market relevance — such as new products, new features that significantly impact existing products, and company updates — are announced on the [Blog](https://vtex.com/en-us/blog/) and in the monthly product newsletter.
