This document presents the availability, service SLAs, and additional support resources offered by VTEX. Learn more about VTEX Support in [How does VTEX Support work?](/en/faq/como-funciona-o-suporte-da-vtex--3kACEfni4m8Yxa1vnf2ebe). 

## First response time for all tickets

The average **first response time** for all tickets is **20 minutes**. **Copilot AI** assists with triaging and drafting the initial response.

To speed up support, include all relevant information in your request  such as context, impact, evidence, and records. Complete requests allow for more accurate and effective responses.

Urgent tickets are prioritized to address critical incidents. **Non-urgent requests** may vary in first response time but still benefit from the support of **Copilot AI** in the initial reply.

### Non-urgent requests

Non-urgent requests are classified into three priority levels, as shown in the table below:

| Level | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| High | Important features of your VTEX store are unavailable or extremely slow, with no viable workaround. |  A promotion fails to apply, or products fail to sync from a seller to a marketplace. |
| Normal | Important features of your VTEX store are unavailable or slow, but a viable workaround exists.  | A known issue impacts your store, but a temporary solution is in place. |
| Low | Tasks or questions about features or documentation. | Can you set up local holidays on the platform? |

## Urgent tickets

Urgent tickets report critical issues with direct impact on sales. The following scenarios are considered urgent:

| Scenario | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| VTEX Platform unavailable | Storefront or Admin completely down Incident opened on our [Status page](https://status.vtex.com) |
| Checkout unavailable | Shipping calculations preventing order completion Uncalculated tax preventing order completion Cart or checkout pages down (totally unavailable) |
| Unable to fulfill orders | Order status not being updated Order feed or hook not working |
| Store usability unavailable | Users can't add items to the cart Users can't register on the site Internal search with no response |

> ⚠️ Urgent tickets will receive emergency support exclusively via [Zendesk](/en/tutorial/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM).

## Ticket priority classification

Ticket priority is determined by the information provided in the submission form. Below are the possible scenarios:

| Source | Type | Users impacted | Impact | Priority |
|-------------|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Financial | | | | Low |
| Technical | Question | | | Low |
| | Task | | | Low |
| | Incident | Internal | Low | Low |
| | | | Moderate | Normal |
| | | | High | High |
| | | External / All | Low | Normal |
| | | | Moderate | High |
| | | | High | Urgent |

The VTEX Support team may adjust a ticket's priority at any time if it determines that it doesn't align with the priority table descriptions. You can check the priority of your tickets directly in the [VTEX Support panel](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests).
