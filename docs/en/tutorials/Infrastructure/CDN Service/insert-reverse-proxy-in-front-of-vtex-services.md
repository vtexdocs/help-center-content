> Implementing a reverse proxy means replacing all edge services (CDN) managed and optimized by VTEX. This implies that the store will be responsible for effective site provisioning, including configuration, monitoring, and management of aspects such as header passing, cookies, and caching. VTEX does not provide support or documentation for these specific configurations and is not responsible for any issues that may arise.

To point your own CDN to the VTEX CDN, you need to insert a reverse proxy in front of VTEX services. In this scenario, the traffic flow follows this path:

1. Store: The point of origin of the traffic.  
2. Reverse proxy: The intermediary you set up.  
3. CDN used by VTEX: VTEX's standard CDN.  
4. VTEX: VTEX's end servers.

Follow the guidelines below to implement the reverse proxy:

* [DNS configuration](#dns-configuration)
* [Traffic routing](#traffic-routing)
* [Responsibilities for SSL certificates](#responsibilities-for-ssl-certificates)

## DNS configuration

In your domain's DNS zone, you must configure the DNS records required to direct traffic to the VTEX CDN. Follow the instructions below.

### Creating a TXT record

To correctly direct your domain to the VTEX CDN, create a TXT record in the format `_{hostname}` with the value `{hostname}.cdn.vtex.com`.

Replace `{hostname}` with your store's [subdomain, domain, and top-level domain](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/configurar-o-dominio-da-loja--tutorials_2450). Example: `www.mystore.com`. Make sure to include the underscore (`_`) before the hostname.

Format:

```
Name: _{hostname}
Type: TXT
 Value: {hostname}.cdn.vtex.com
```

Example:

```
Name: _www.mystore.com
 Type: TXT
 Value: www.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com
```

### Creating a CNAME record

To direct CDN/WAF traffic to our servers, create a CNAME record with the value corresponding to the domain's CNAME.

Replace `{hostname}` with your store's subdomain, domain, and top-level domain. Example: `www.mystore.com`.

Format:

```
Name: {hostname}
 Type: CNAME
 Destination: {hostname}.cdn.vtex.com
```

Example:

```
Name: www.mystore.com
 Type: CNAME
 Destination: www.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com
```

## Traffic routing

In the reverse proxy configuration file, configure traffic routing to VTEX, ensuring that the `Host` header contains the original domain. Use the format below for HTTP requests from the reverse proxy to VTEX:

```curl
curl http://{hostname}.cdn.vtex.com/ -H 'Host: {hostname}'
```

Example:

```curl
curl http://www.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com/ -H 'Host: www.mystore.com'
```

The traffic routing configuration and the HTTP request format may vary depending on the reverse proxy software solution you use.

## Responsibilities for SSL certificates

In the case of a reverse proxy, responsibilities for SSL certificates are as follows:

* The external CDN (reverse proxy) manages the SSL certificate for communication between the client and the reverse proxy.  
* VTEX manages the SSL certificate for communication between the reverse proxy (external CDN) and VTEX servers.

To enable the generation of SSL certificates, make sure that all HTTP traffic to `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` reaches VTEX without changes, such as internal redirects from HTTP to HTTPS or traffic blocks.

Some reverse proxies may capture this route, preventing VTEX from issuing or renewing the SSL certificate.

>⚠️ VTEX only provides navigation if:
>
> *The host points to VTEX via the CNAME.
>
> *SSL certificates can be issued and renewed for the host.
>
> If either condition is not met, navigation will fail, and the site will be down.
