__No__. Our SaaS-based platform is totally independent of the client’s infrastructure in relation to web services, depending only on the pointing on your domain’s DNS zone.

Note that, in spite of this, we do not provide free-of-charge hosting. The same is true of the email service, which is not provided by VTEX\*.

It is normal for these services to be included in a combined sale, consisting of domain, DNS zone, hosting and email in the same package.

Hosting can be useful for several purposes, such as storing images for email marketing (sometimes sent out through FTP, but which can also be sent to VTEX), hosting institutional sites or ones which do not belong to the virtual store (such as a blog in WordPress) and other resources of the company.

\*Except for the sending of transaction emails, where the server (SMTP) belongs to VTEX, but which depends on there being a valid, pre-authorized email address.
