VTEX Healthcheck is a public page that aims to monitor the status of our platform services. At Healthcheck, we have over 100 tests running per minute. Through this dashboard, you can track the health of each module in real time.

## How the status tests work

Each module has robots that make requests with the goal of checking the status of the service. If the module responds successfully, it means the service is working correctly. In Healthcheck, the module will appear with the `Healthy` sign.

If the robot receives an unexpected response __twice__, a `Warning` alert will appear in this module's box in Healthcheck. At this stage, our team will be already mobilizing to resolve a possible instability of the module. At this point, your store is __not__ being impacted.

If the robot receives an unexpected answer __three times in a row__, an `Unhealthy` alert will appear in this module's box in Healthcheck. If this instability is affecting your store's sales, this will be reported on our [status page](http://status.vtex.com/).

## What each box in Healthcheck means

### Orders I and Orders II

These boxes monitor the closure of purchases in stores. If they are marked `Healthy`, it means that purchases are being closed normally.

In __Orders I__, the tests are done from our internal network. In __Orders II__, the tests are done from an external network. These two checks are important for testing connectivity from different datacenters.
