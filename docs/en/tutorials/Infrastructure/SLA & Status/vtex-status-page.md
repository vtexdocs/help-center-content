On the [VTEX Status](https://status.vtex.com/) page, you can monitor the platform's stability in real time and access the full incident history.

Our team reports events whenever our automatic monitoring system identifies an instability in the platform modules. Scheduled maintenance is also reported in detail on this page.

![statuspage-1](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/qECQAjnWxwGH47wzXDv6c/d8aea2fa393bfb699b6ea71b9b59d7a9/statuspage-1.png)

Below, you can find details of the VTEX platform's status page elements, developed with the [incident.io](https://incident.io/) tool:

* [Report a problem](#reporting-a-problem)
* [Notifications](#notifications)
* [General status](#general-status)
* [System status](#system-status)
* [Calendar](#calendar)
* [Incident logs](#incident-logs)
* [Scheduled maintenance logs](#scheduled-maintenance-logs)

## Reporting a problem

By clicking the `Report a problem` button in the top right corner of the page, you can contact [our support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) team to let us know about platform instabilities.

## Notifications

The status page displays the `Subscribe to updates` button in the top right corner. By clicking it, you can subscribe to receive updates via email, [RSS feed](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/), or [Slack](https://slack.com/).

By choosing the email subscription option, you can receive notifications only for certain components. To do so, select the **Subscribe to specific components** option. Then, check the components you want to monitor.

## General status

In this section, you can view the platform's general status, which can be _fully operational_, _experiencing issues_, or _undergoing maintenance_.

When problems or maintenance affect a system, the impacted component and the incident description are displayed. See examples below.

![statuspage-3](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/16vditkk4vdDH5NGhGp7zJ/21bc090adf8b43e7579831a500e4b627/statuspage-3.png)

## System status

In this section, you can check the status of each platform system and its components in real time.

By clicking the arrow <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i> next to the number of components, you can view the status of specific components for each system.

If maintenance is scheduled for a future date, you will also see the `Upcoming maintenance scheduled` button, as shown below. Hovering over this button will display the scheduled maintenance event. You can click to view its log.

![statuspage-7](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/01rsFj3g2ZIyQfGvVj1U3F/1fbf5de5c36e02ec2bfd6204471a2ebf/statuspage-7.png)

![statuspage-8](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2aRBMeTVELfszcFQFpXyUJ/8ca30c0cd6d89aaca8d92dc21af7274e/statuspage-8.png)

>⚠️ If the scheduled maintenance lasts longer than a day, only the start date will be selected in the calendar. You must open the [ maintenance log](#scheduled-maintenance-logs) to see the start and end dates.

Below, we detail the information available in the [incident log](#incident-logs) and the [scheduled maintenance log](#scheduled-maintenance-logs).

## Incident logs

The incident details page displays the following information:

![status-page-9-en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2jNJB6z7HrvDzQMLi1W4KW/6cacbbfc2e5b7e99bf4309e3622edda4/status-page-9-en.png)

* **Title:** Title describing the incident.
* **Status:** Each incident has a defined cycle in which our team works to identify and solve problems. These are stages of this cycle:
    * **Investigating:** The incident's first status focuses on analyzing the impacts and related services and identifying the root cause.
    * **Identified:** With the origin of the error properly identified, the development team begins to perform actions towards the solution.
    * **Monitoring:** After completing the system stabilization actions, with the operation indicators normalized, we continue to stay in alert and closely monitor the performance of impacted services or modules.
    * **Resolved:** Once the platform's performance is stabilized, we return to normal monitoring and consider that the platform is working as expected.
* **Duration:** Time taken to solve the incident.
* **Summary:** Text summarizing the incident.
* **Affected components:** The platform components impacted by the incident. By clicking the arrow next to the number of components, you can view the impact on more specific components.
* **Updates**: Timeline with incident updates and status changes.

By clicking the `Subscribe to updates` button on an incident log, you can sign up to receive updates on that specific incident via email, RSS feed, or Slack.

## Scheduled maintenance logs

Platform updates are made constantly and generally do not impact our clients' operations. However, occasionally, some of them require the service to be temporarily unavailable.

For cases that affect the platform's stability, we use the VTEX status page to inform you of all the details, such as when the maintenance will be carried out, its duration, and its impact.

The scheduled maintenance log displays the same information as the incident logs. The possible statuses for a scheduled maintenance are:

* **Scheduled:** The maintenance event is scheduled.
* **In progress:** The maintenance event is in progress.
* **Complete:** The maintenance event has been completed

Below are some examples illustrating the status and timeline of scheduled maintenance events.
