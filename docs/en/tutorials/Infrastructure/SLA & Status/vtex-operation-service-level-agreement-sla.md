The [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://vtex.com/us-en/privacy-and-agreements/agreements/) is a document that regulates the use of the VTEX platform under the terms of the contract between VTEX and the customer, who is the contractor. This document specifies all the services that a contractor can expect from VTEX.

The SLA expresses the service level of the platform's infrastructure and technically clarifies its operational uptime and downtime, as well as all the events that are or are not counted as incidents.
