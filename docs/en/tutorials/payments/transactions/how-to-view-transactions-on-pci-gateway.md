All orders in which payment is transacted by VTEX are logged to the **Orders** section. Beyond payment data, all the steps taken in the order flow, as communication with the operator, antifraud etc, are recorded.

On the main interface, you can find all transactions listed, from the most recent to the oldest.

This listing indicates the current status, the start (date and time) of the transaction, the customer's name, the order's ID, the payment method used to close the order and the value transacted.
