At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Getnet Chile payment provider. With this provider, your store can make sales through credit, debit and co-branded cards, notes payable, PlaceToPay and Getnet Chile.

To configure Getnet Chile, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Getnet-Chile__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. In __Provider Authorization__, fill in the __App Key__ and __App token__ fields with data provided by Getnet Chile.
5. If you wish to modify the identification name to be displayed for the Getnet Chile provider on the VTEX Admin screen, enter the information in the __Name__ field in __Basic Information__.
6. In __Payment Control__, select whether you want to activate the provider in a test environment by clicking __Enable test mode__.
7. Click `Save`.
