The __Custom Payments__ functionality is an alternative to the standard options offered by the Payments module. With it, you can create up to 60 (sixty) new payment methods — such as cash on delivery or store-issued cards.

Custom payment methods are organized into three categories — notes payable, store cards (private label), and store cards (co-branded) — each allowing up to 20 (twenty) configurations.

## Notes Payable

A Note Payable is a promise of payment that needs manual approval of the seller to perform the transaction. It is often used to provide payment through money. To configure Notes Payable, access the documentation [Setting up payments with Notes Payable](/en/tutorial/setting-up-payments-with-notes-payable).

## Store Cards (Private label)

It allows the use of a store's credit card with its own brand. To configure this payment method, access the documentation [Setting up Private Label payments](/en/tutorial/setting-up-private-label-payments).

## Store Cards (Co-Branded)

It allows the use of a store's credit card in partnership with one of the following networks: MasterCard, Visa, Amex and Diners. To configure this payment method, access the documentation [Setting up payments with Store Card (cobranded)](/en/tutorial/setting-up-payments-with-store-card-cobranded).

After this configuration, the creation of a [Payment Condition](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions) is required.

> ⚠️ We recommend using the automatic approval only in cases where the payment will be made upon delivery or pickup at the store. This option releases the payment of the order, meaning that the order automatically switches to the Preparing Delivery status, without payment verification.
