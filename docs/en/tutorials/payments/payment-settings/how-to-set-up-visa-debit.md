To set up payments made with Visa Debit at your store, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.

### Create payment condition

First, you need to create a payment condition to enable Visa Debit in the Checkout.
To do so, in **Settings** access the menu of **Payment conditions** options:

### Display credit cards in Checkout

After completing the setup of Visa Debit payment conditions, you will see a new tab in the Checkout called “Debit Card”. This tab will include the “Visa Debit” option, which can be selected by the customer. 

**Important**: The customer must have a payments gateway that allows transactions with debit cards, in addition to being integrated with VTEX.
