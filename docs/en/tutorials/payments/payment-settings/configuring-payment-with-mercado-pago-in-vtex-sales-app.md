At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the payment provider Mercado Pago. Through this connector, your store can offer payment transactions in physical stores (VTEX Sales App), using points of sale (POS). For more information access [What is VTEX Sales App?](/en/tracks/instore-getting-started-and-setting-up--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/7fnnVlG3Kv1Tay9iagc5yf).

To use the MercadoPagoV2 provider in the VTEX Sales App, you need to:

- [Configure keys in the Mercado Pago environment](#configure-keys-in-the-mercado-pago-environment)

## Configure keys in the Mercado Pago environment

The following steps describe the minimum configurations to be carried out so that the MercadoPagoV2 connector is properly configured. Other personalized settings applied to customers, enabling specific payment methods or particular features of the platform, must be carried out in accordance with [Mercado Pago documentation](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/docs/vtex/integration/create-gateway-affiliation-v2).

<blockquote><ui>1. Access the [Mercado Pago developer portal](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en) to create a new account.</ui>

<blockquote><ui>> ⚠️ The Mercado Pago developer portal allows the user to obtain information on all the keys necessary to configure the connection between VTEX and Mercado Pago. We recommend that the procedure below be carried out by a user who already has access to the other keys to their Mercado Pago account.</blockquote>

<blockquote><ui>2. After logging in, access the Mercado Pago [credentials documentation](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/docs/vtex/additional-content/your-integrations/credentials) to check how to obtain the **Public Key** and **Access Token** that will be used to configure MercadoPagoV2 on VTEX.</ui>
