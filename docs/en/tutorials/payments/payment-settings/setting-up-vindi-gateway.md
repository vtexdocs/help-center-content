At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Vindi payment provider. With this provider, your store can make sales through the credit cards, bank slips and Paypal.

To configure Vindi, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __Vindi__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with the data provided by Vindi.
5. Click `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Vindi, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, Vindi provider may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
