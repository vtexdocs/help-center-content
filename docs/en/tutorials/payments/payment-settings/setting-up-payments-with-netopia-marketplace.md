At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Netopia Marketplace payment provider. With this provider, your store can make sales through credit and debit cards, note payables and digital wallets.

To configure Netopia Marketplace, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payment > Providers__, or type __Providers__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the providers screen, click the `New Provider` button.
3. Type the name __NetopiaMarketplace__ in the search bar and click on the name of the provider.
4. In __Provider Authorization__, fill in the __App Key__ and __App token__ fields with data provided by Netopia Marketplace.
5. If you wish to modify the identification name to be displayed for the Netopia Marketplace provider on the VTEX Admin screen, enter the information in the __Name__ field in __Basic Information__.
6. In __Payment Control__, select whether you want to activate the provider in a test environment by clicking __Enable test mode__.
7. If you want to use [payment split](/en/tutorial/split-payment--6k5JidhYRUxileNolY2VLx) in your store, select the option __Enable payout split and send payment recipients__ and indicate the __Accountable for payment processing charges__ and __Accountable for chargebacks__ (marketplace, sellers or marketplaces and sellers).
8. In __Provider Fields__, select or complete the fields __POS ID__, __Environment__, __Delay to auto cancel (hours)__, and __Delay to auto capture (minutes)__ according to the provider's instructions.
9. Click `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Netopia Marketplace, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, Netopia Marketplace may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
