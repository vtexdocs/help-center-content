>ℹ️ To install the Subscriptions module, please contact [our Support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests).

The **Subscriptions** system is an app developed by VTEX to facilitate recurring sales. It works as an automatic scheduler, repeating orders according to the frequency chosen by your customer.

Your costumer can indicate how often they would like to repurchase a certain product and the system will automatically resubmit the purchase order according to the selected frequency, on a recurring basis.

This purchase will be made automatically, according to the selected frequency, with the same characteristics configured in the original order. Subscription is a simple way to save your customer's time and to provide a scheduled sales flow to your store.

To activate this feature, you will need to:

1. [Install the Subscriptions app](#1-install-the-subscriptions-app)
2. [Configure payment methods](#2-configure-payment-methods)
3. [Create a subscription plan](#3-create-a-subscription-plan)
4. [Configure roles for subscriptions](#4-configure-roles-for-subscriptions)

## 1. Install the Subscriptions app

>⚠️ Currently, the installation of the Subscriptions module is done only by [our Support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests).

To install the free Subscriptions app from the [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/), follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX App Store, go to the [Subscriptions](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-admin-subscriptions/p) app page.
2. Click `Get app`.
3. In **Type your account**, enter the name of your VTEX account.
4. Click `Confirm`.
5. In your shopping cart in the VTEX App Store, click `Place Order`.
6. Click `Go to the installation page`.
7. In VTEX Admin, click `Install`.

After installation, the app settings will be available in VTEX Admin under **Orders > Subscriptions**.

## 2. Configure payment methods

To configure payment methods for subscription orders, please follow the steps below.

1. Log in to the **Subscriptions module** of your Admin. 
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Toggle the checkbox next to the payment method you want to activate to **Activated**.

Currently, the following payment methods are enabled for subscription orders:

* **Boleto (popular Brazilian off-line payment method)**
* **Credit card**

>ℹ️ To make the **Credit card** payment option available, contact your store's acquirer and make sure they accept recurring purchase transactions coming from tokenized cards (no CVV). The **Subscriptions** system will use the same card data from the first purchase to place subsequent subscription orders, ensuring the security of the entire process.

To enable this type of transaction in the connector, the store manager must ask the acquirer for permission to process recurring payments. Check out our article [Registering gateway affiliations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/registering-gateway-affiliations--tutorials_444).

## 3. Create a subscription plan

In the __Subscriptions__ module, you need to create subscription plans to offer to your customers and to associate products with these plans. The plans indicate that the Subscriptions feature is active for certain products and display the available subscription frequencies. Please refer to the article [Creating a subscription plan](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-criar-um-plano-de-assinatura-beta--1qGRoFczm98Wgt81f9mUqC) to learn more about this process.

There is another option to create a subscription plan, which involves manually creating an SKU attachment in the __Catalog__. In this case, the **SKU attachment** is responsible for indicating that the Subscription feature is active for that SKU and which order frequencies are available. Check out the article [How to create a subscription attachment](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-criar-um-anexo-de-assinatura--2bUuKyPflA8cOGLv8OvaKK) to learn more about this process.

## 4. Configure roles for Subscriptions

There are a number of subscription-related features available in the **Roles** module of your store. These features allow your VTEX Admin users to access certain features in order to operate the Subscriptions module. To learn more about roles, please read this [article](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role).

>⚠️ If the user does not have the permissions required to access the data on the **Subscriptions** pages, the system will display a warning stating that they do not have those permissions, and the user will be unable to view the data.

See the table below for features related to the Subscriptions module.
