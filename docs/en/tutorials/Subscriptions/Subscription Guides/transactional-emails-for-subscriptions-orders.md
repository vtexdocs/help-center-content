All communication with your customer about [Subscriptions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-a-assinatura--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453) will take place through the **Email Templates** module. Transactional emails related to subscriptions are fully customizable and are installed by default in the VTEX Admin.

To access transactional emails for subscriptions orders, check out the walk-through below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Email Templates > Templates**, or type **Templates** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Search for _Subscriptions_ in the search box, or use the filters.
3. Click on the card of the desired template to configure it.
4. Make the desired changes.
5. Clique `Save`.

You can also [create your own email template](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-the-message-center--tutorials_84).

## How your customer tracks their subscription orders

>ℹ️ In [My Account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-my-account-works--2BQ3GiqhqGJTXsWVuio3Xh), customers can only access their orders from the last two years.

Each action that occurs within the **Subscriptions** order flow contains a trigger that sends an email notifying your customer. After activating the subscription, your customer will receive emails with details of the status of each subscription order every time they perform an action.

It is not necessary to activate the email sending manually, since they are sent automatically according to each scenario included in **Email Templates**. However, if you wish, you can disable the sending of specific emails:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Email Templates > Templates**, or type **Templates** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Search for _Subscriptions_ in the search box, or use the filters.
3. Click on the card of the desired template to configure it.
4. Uncheck the `Enable sending emails?` box, that is checked by default.
5. Click `Save`.
