>ℹ️ This feature is currently in beta, which means we are working on improving it.

**VTEX Data Pipeline** is a tool that only VTEX clients can leverage, which allows exploring and analyzing the ecommerce data that is currently available on our servers. **Data Pipeline** is a VTEX add-on product that integrates the data from your ecommerce website to the data warehouse and BI tools of your choice cleanly and securely.  

## Security and privacy  

**VTEX Data Pipeline** improves security for your ecommerce website data by establishing a direct and secure connection from our data warehouse to your data infrastructure tool. This approach eliminates the need to rely on ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) processes that run on third-party tools, providing direct and secure control over the flow of data. In addition, a key aspect of our solution is the proactive removal of all personally identifiable information (PII) of the users listed in the tables, thus meeting the best data protection practices.  

## What is a data dictionary?  

This dictionary contains all the datasets that **VTEX Data Pipeline** has available, described in a dedicated section that includes details of their characteristics.  

Each section contains information such as the following:  

- Data characteristics  
  - Data source  
  - Availability to client  
  - History  
  - Minimum update interval  
- Dataset tables
