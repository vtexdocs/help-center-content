The order dataset is composed of two main tables: `orders_historical` and `orders_latest`. These tables include several `SUPER` fields that encompass information such acquired items, shipping details, related sellers, payments, among others.

We have implemented special auxiliary tables, such as `orders_shipping` and `orders_items` to help manage this data, which can be a complex task due to the 1-to-N relationship between many of the `SUPER` fields and the orders and the amount of information they contain.

When running analyses, it's common to create direct selections in the `SUPER` fields to highlight specific parts for extraction. You can also join one of the main tables (`orders` or `latest`) to the auxiliary tables, using orderid as key.

This method allows you to efficiently extract specific information, enabling a detailed analysis of the orders and their related components.

This section includes the following information:

- [Characteristics of order data](#data-characteristics)

## Analyses with order data

Order data can be used in the following analyses:

- **Ecommerce website sales analysis:** Evaluate sales volume, identify best-selling products, analyze seasonal trends, and get insights into consumer behavior.  
- **Order cancellation rate analysis:** Look into cancellation reasons, identify patterns related to specific products or logistical problems, and develop strategies to reduce cancellation rates.  
- **SKU performance:** Analyze the performance of individual SKUs, understand market demand, and make adjustments to inventory and marketing strategies.  

## Correlations with other data

The order dataset has correlations with the following sets of the VTEX data ecosystem:

- **Navigation:** Correlating navigation data with orders offers insights into consumer behavior and the purchasing journey, which helps optimize the user experience.  
- **Promotions:** Interaction with promotion data is key for assessing the effectiveness of promotional campaigns on order volumes and types.  
- **Transactions:** Joint analysis with transaction data can reveal payment patterns, consumer preferences, and payment processing efficiency.
