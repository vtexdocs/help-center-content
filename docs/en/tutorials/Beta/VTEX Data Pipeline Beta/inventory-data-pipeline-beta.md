The dataset of the `item_inventory` table provides information about the availability of items in the inventory, specifying the total quantity of available items, active reservations, unlimited inventory option, as well as SKU and inventory IDs. This table also records updates with timestamps and control IDs.  

This section includes the following information:  

- [Inventory data characteristics](#data-characteristics)
- [Table: item_update_latest](#table-item-update-latest)
- [Table: item_update_historical](#table-item-update-historical)
- [Analyses with item_inventory](#analyses-with-inventory)
- [Correlations with other data](#correlations-with-other-data)

## Analyses with inventory

Some of the analyses that can be run using the inventory table are mentioned below:

- **Inventory level analysis:** Assess whether the inventory meets demand and identify items at risk of running out of stock.
- **Inventory reservation trends:** Analyze the number of items that have been reserved over time to identify patterns and adjust inventory management strategies.
- **Inventory distribution analysis by account:** Optimize inventory management across multiple accounts and understand how inventory is distributed.

## Correlations with other data

Inventory data correlates with order and product sets, and provides a more comprehensive analysis for purchases, sales, and marketing. Some examples are: 

- **Interaction with order data:** Joint analysis with order data offers insights about how efficiently is customer demand being met and helps forecast restocking needs.
- **Relationship with SKUs:** Integration with SKU data helps manage inventory based on product popularity and availability.
- **Purchase and supplier data:** Coordination with purchase data allows you to maintain an ideal inventory balance, which avoids overstocking or shortages.
- **Sales and marketing analysis:** Understanding inventory directly impacts marketing and sales strategies, which allows aligning promotions and campaigns with product availability.
