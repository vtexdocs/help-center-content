>ℹ️ This feature is in beta, which means that we are working to improve it. If you have any questions, please contact <a href= "https://help.vtex.com/en/support">our Support</a>.

>⚠️ To use the feature, it is required to have [franchise accounts](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-conta-franquia--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl) associated with the [main account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/trilha-da-loja-vtex--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4yPqZQyj0t675QpcG7H6yl#vtex-account-types).

The **Operational Capacity** page allows you to manage the sellers' capacity to receive and handle the store's orders to optimize your logistics network. You can monitor the order allocation between sellers and perform [actions](#acoes-na-pagina-de-detalhes-do-seller) to improve order allocation between them.

A good seller operational capacity management leads to the following advantages:

- Better reallocates product demand between different sellers' warehouses.
- Optimizes order shipping times by avoiding overloading sellers.
- Improves the shopping experience for customers, who receive their orders on time.

When you go to the VTEX Admin under **Shipping > Operational Capacity**, you will find a page like the one below:

![operational_capacity_image1_EN](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5k7wWTuVZk7Ylc2IHpNE5C/87f03e4f1a667a76349095e450244602/operational_capacity_image1_EN.png)

>⚠️ The sellers displayed on the interface are your operation's sellers, previously configured by our team. To add a new seller, contact [our Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) team.

The chart shows the following data:

- **Total sellers:** Total number of sellers in your operation.
- **Active:** Number of sellers receiving new orders.
- **Paused:** Number of sellers who are paused and not receiving new orders.
- **Number of sellers that exceeded capacity:** Number of sellers that received more orders than their configured limit. You can view results from the last `7 days` or `28 days`.

The **Operational Capacity** page displays the following information:

| **Column** | **Description** |
| :----------: | :---------- |
| Name | Identification of the <a href="https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-um-seller--5FkLvhZ3Few4CWWIuYOK2w">seller</a> to which the operational capacity refers. |
| Capacity Usage | <p>Percentage of operational capacity used on the day.</p><p><b>Example:</b> A seller with the capacity to handle 100 orders has used 80% of its capacity for the day.

### Monitoring capacity usage

The **Operational Capacity Status** chart shows, in real time, the percentage of the seller's capacity that has already been used, as in the image below:

![operational_capacity_image2_EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/510RtT3ugOksM3YD5tYSGc/0bed6fad834c5b5ab6d22ce713abd11d/operational_capacity_image2_EN.png)

The chart shows the following periods:

- Today
- Tomorrow
- Date of the next two days

If you set up the _Continue to receive orders by consuming the capacity of the following days_ [rule](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/capacidade-operacional-beta--2thSYLMAS8KAd8V4XuBLSy#iii-rule) for the seller, the chart will display the percentage of operational capacity for the following days already used for orders from previous days. Learn more in [Editing the seller's operational capacity](#editing-the-sellers-operational-capacity).

### Editing the seller's operational capacity

In the **Operational Capacity** section, you can see the seller's current operational capacity settings for each day of the week, as in the following image:

![operational_capacity_image3_EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/70kbPFFifh8ykCHvIj6vEZ/7aa99cf4ff1a7deb322671c5e1961537/operational_capacity_image3_EN.png)

To change these settings, follow the steps below:

1. In the **Operational Capacity** section, click `Edit`.
2. Change the desired options:
    - [I - Operational Capacity Unit](#i-operational-capacity-unit)
    - [II - Capacity](#ii-capacity)
    - [III - Rule](#iii-rule)
3. Click `Save Changes`.

Below are the field descriptions mentioned in the instructions.

#### I - Operational Capacity Unit

Choose whether operational capacity is defined by the number of _orders_ or _items_. The number of items considers the items of all the orders placed that day.

#### II - Capacity

Set the seller's operational capacity limit for each day of the week. The system does not set a maximum value.

When the configured limit is reached, your store keeps receiving new orders, which can be allocated to other sellers or to the same seller but within the capacity for the following days. This will depend on the rule you choose.

#### III - Rule

Choose the rule for when the seller reaches maximum capacity for the day:

- **Continue to receive orders by consuming the capacity of the following days:** The seller keeps receiving new orders when the capacity is reached, which are allocated to the capacity of the following days. The delivery promise for the next orders is adjusted at checkout. You can't configure this period in hours because it automatically adjusts to correspond to the number of following days allocated.
  - If you choose this rule, determine the number of following days to allocate orders that exceed the current day's capacity.
  > **Example:** A seller sells chocolates, and its operational capacity today reached 100%. The seller keeps receiving new orders, but they will be handled the next day, as the team can only handle orders already scheduled for today. At checkout, the delivery promise for new orders now displays a day later, as the orders will be handled tomorrow. If tomorrow's capacity is consumed today, new orders will be allocated for the day after tomorrow and handled in two days. This is because the store has set up a period of three days to receive orders by using the following days' capacity.
- **Pause this seller until the end of the day:** Once a seller reaches their capacity limit for the day, they stop receiving new orders, which are allocated to other sellers.

## Choosing between pausing or increasing operational capacity

To decide whether the best strategy for your business is to [edit a seller's operational capacity](#-editing-the-sellers-operational-capacity) or [pause](#pause-and-activate-the-sellers-operational-capacity) them, it's important to understand the following:

- **Paused seller:** The seller stops receiving new orders until they are reactivated. Even if the rule _Continue to receive orders by consuming the capacity of the following days_ is configured, new orders are not accepted.
  > **Example:** The seller's store had problems with their facilities, affecting the handling of new orders. In this case, it is strategic to pause the seller and only reactivate them once they are able to handle orders again.
- **Seller reached the maximum limit:** When the seller reaches 100% capacity, they stop receiving new orders for that day. However, their operational capacity becomes fully available the next day, and they automatically receive new orders.
  > **Example:** On Christmas Eve, the seller reached its maximum capacity for the day and could not handle more orders, so it would not be worth [increasing the seller's operational capacity](#editing-the-sellers-operational-capacity). Since new orders can be handled the next day, there's no need to edit the seller, as their capacity will reset and be available to receive new orders again.

### Comprehensive seller operational capacity

When customers don't enter their location on your store, they can see your store's products (seller 1) and those from [comprehensive sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-abrangente--5Qn4O2GpjUIzWTPpvLUfkI).

Due to a platform limitation, when you deactivate the operational capacity of a comprehensive seller, their products are still displayed on the store, but customers can't buy them. 
We therefore recommend leaving the comprehensive sellers' operational capacity enabled at all times.
