>ℹ️ The **Releases** is in beta version, which means we are working to improve it. This feature is only available for stores using [FastStore](https://www.faststore.dev/).

The **Releases** module allows you to [manage your releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-actions-on-releases-beta--1zsomdifPEQkdV6RW93JyW) so that you can coordinate the creation, schedule and publication of the changes in your store.

You'll find the **Calendar** and [Releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-releases-page-beta--2p7IiVD6K8i1iRiwHph5sw) pages in the navigation menu of the **Releases** in the VTEX Admin. You can create a new release and perform other [actions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-actions-on-releases-beta--1zsomdifPEQkdV6RW93JyW) under __Calendar__.

You can view the **Calendar** page in three ways:

* [View per month](#view-per-month): It shows the releases scheduled for every day of the month you selected.
* [View per week](#view-per-week): It shows the releases scheduled for a certain week.
* [View per day](#view-per-day): It shows the releases scheduled for the selected day and the changes related to the selected release.

**Calendar** only shows [scheduled releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-actions-on-releases-beta--1zsomdifPEQkdV6RW93JyW#schedule). To view all your releases, access the [Releases](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/planner-releases-page-beta--2p7IiVD6K8i1iRiwHph5sw) page.

>⚠️ In the beta version, the releases must be [CMS](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/cms--2YcpgIljVaLVQYMzxQbc3z/4yB9wSl79cArd68aRBnBZ2)-related, because other VTEX platform modules are not yet included. To use the **Releases**, you must configure the CMS as described in [Installing Releases on VTEX Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/cms/vtex-headless-cms/Installing%20Releases%20on%20VTEX%20Headless%20CMS).
