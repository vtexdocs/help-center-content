>ℹ️ The updated version of the Store Overview (beta) page is available for use free of charge on the VTEX Admin during the beta phase or until stipulated by VTEX. It is important to note that charges may apply in the future. For the time being, the current version of the Store Overview page on the VTEX Admin will continue to be available.

The Store Overview (Beta) page in your VTEX Admin provides real-time tracking of your operation on the current day, giving visibility into indicators that allow you and your team to get feedback about actions applied to the store and to quickly implement improvements.

This tool is available on the homepage of the VTEX Admin. To view it, click **Dashboards > Overview** in the navigation menu, or type _Overview_ in the search bar at the top of the page.

In this article, we describe the main page sections and actions. You will learn more about:

- [Page data](#page-data)
- [Analyzing results and operation health](#analyzing-results-and-operation-health)
-	[Period comparison](#comparing-periods)
- [Views](#views)
- [Monitoring](#monitoring)
- [Metrics](#metrics)

## Page data

The metrics on this page include order and browsing data collected by different systems.

>⚠️ The revenue metric may differ from the average ticket metric recorded in the OMS and Sales Performance, for example. This is because Sales Performance considers an order's item values, while OMS also considers discounts, freight, fees, and promotions applied to the order, which may increase or decrease its final total.

-	**Orders and revenue:** The order and revenue data comes from the VTEX Order Management System (OMS) and includes orders placed on all your sales channels.
-	**Sessions:** The browsing data comes from the platform’s internal system, which collects user sessions from storefronts of VTEX stores. Sessions represent the total number of views on pages accessed by a single user while browsing through your ecommerce store, excluding marketplaces, apps, VTEX Sales App, or other sales channels.

## Data restrictions

We do not collect browsing data from non-VTEX storefronts or from sellers who only offer products on external marketplaces.  This means that the charts displayed in the [Monitoring](#monitoring) section may not be available, depending on whether we collected browsing data from your store.

Although we aim to show a maximum of 3% divergence from the VTEX OMS data, sometimes you may find discrepancies between the data reported on the Store Overview dashboard and the OMS data.

### Data update

Different page data have different update frequencies. The charts in the [Monitoring](#monitoring) section may be updated as often as every three minutes, depending on the [View](#view), while other sections are updated every 15 minutes. The <i class='fas fa-circle-notch blue-color'></i>  "1 min" label shows the last time that the page data was updated.

## Analyzing results and operation health 

You can use different metrics and monitoring charts for analyzing results, depending on what you want to explore. The table below can help guide your analysis. Click each metric listed in the table to learn more about how it is calculated and how it works.

| Objective         | Related metrics and charts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Financial results | - Revenue captured <br>- [Average ticket](#monitoring) <br>- [Highest grossing products](#metrics)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Conversion        | - [Conversion rate](#metrics) <br>- [Sales funnel](#sales-funnel) <br>- [Orders captured](#monitoring), compared to the number of canceled orders. Depending on the outcome, this can guide your team to identify operational problems in fulfillment or customer service that resulted in canceled orders. |

>ℹ️ Keep in mind that while the Monitoring charts are updated within three minutes, Metrics charts take fifteen minutes to be updated, which can influence the analysis of results. Learn more in [Data update](#data-update).

### Analyzing campaign results

If you want to analyze the results generated by campaigns, promotions, or new product launches that occurred in the past, follow the instructions below:

1. Select the **Store** where the action occurred.
2. Select the campaign **Date** to [compare that period](#comparing-periods) with today's date.
3. Select the `Accumulated` [view](#views).
4. Track the hourly performance of metrics.

![EN visão geral Beta acumulado](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/44wg1PRlF5WHD5I6R5Cu8o/787362a926aa9a3b503353d1f691fd49/EN_visa__o_geral_Beta_acumulado.png)

### Tracking the impact of changes in the store

To maintain a healthy and stable operation, it's important to identify if any deploys, campaigns, or setting changes have a negative impact on the number of orders, sessions, or customer conversion immediately after they are applied.

If you want to see the impact of store changes, either to identify negative effects or changes in the health of your business, follow the instructions below.

1. Select the **Store** where the action occurred.
2. Select the `Last 2 hours` [view](#views).
3. Check the pulse of the metrics or inflection points in the chart in the last two hours.
4. [Compare the times](#comparing-periods) of the inflection points with the applied changes to identify their cause and impact.
