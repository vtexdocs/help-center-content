>ℹ️ This feature is in Beta stage, meaning we are working to improve it. If you have any questions, please contact <a href = "https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests">our Support Center</a>.

This new Price Settings (Beta) section allows you to create and manage rules for price lists and change general settings in an easy and fast way. 

## Price General Settings

In this section, you can set the default markup and price variation limit for your store, as well as inherit prices from your parent account and overwrite sellers' prices with those from your account.

- **Default markup for new prices:** default profit percentage over a new price added to a product or service.
- **Use price variation limit:** ensures that SKU prices are not changed to undesired values.
  - **maximum decrease:** highest decrease in the price of a SKU.
  - **maximum increase:** highest increase in the price of a SKU.
- ** In case of nonexistent price, inherit from parent account:** option that allows inheriting prices from a parent account if the price does not exist in the current account.
- **Inherit from parent account:** option that allows the current account to inherit prices from a parent account. The price inheritance is done in the following situations:
  - **Always:** the account will always inherit all the prices from the parent account.
  - **Only for non-existent prices:** the parent account prices will be inherited only if they are non-existent in the current account.

<div class = "alet alert-info">
  <p>The option to <b>inherit prices from parent account</b> is only available for child accounts.</p>
</div>

- **Overwrite seller prices:** this option overwrites all seller prices with the ones from the current account. 

>ℹ️ The configuration **Overwrite prices for sellers** is not available for white label sellers.

## Price table rules

>⚠️ This section is the alternative for clients who used to configure their prices through Pricing V1 UTM. Now you can select a price table for UTM scenarios.

In this section you can create pricing table prioritization rules from specific conditions.

### Strategy

- **Lowest price:** it will configure the store to use the lowest price found in the price tables.
- **Highest price:** it will configure the store to use the highest price found in the price tables.
- **Priority (custom):** it will configure the store to use the first price found according to the priority set for price tables.
