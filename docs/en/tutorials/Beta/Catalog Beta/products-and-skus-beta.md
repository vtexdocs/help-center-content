## Creating a product

When you click the `Add Product` button, the page for adding a new product in the catalog will open. Please read the article [Filling in product registration fields](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/product-registration-fields--4dYXWIK3zyS8IceKkQseke) to learn how to do this. 

## Searching for a product

To find a specific product, you can type one of the following in the search bar:

* Product ID
* SKU ID
* SKU EAN
* Product name
* SKU name
* Product reference code
* SKU reference code

Then, click on the criteria you want to use for the search, as illustrated in the following image:

![products-skus-search-en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3XkJPsJihm6flcVxPksPPO/f0f028bb188ed98868f4fc9738e96511/search-en.gif)

The list of products displayed will then be refreshed according to your search. 

To clear the search, click on the <i class="far fa-times-circle"></i> icon in the search bar.

Select the desired filters and click `Apply` to filter the products. To cancel the selection, click `Clear`.

>⚠️ You cannot filter products by [seller](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-seller--5FkLvhZ3Few4CWWIuYOK2w) or pre-sale date in this Catalog version.

## Tracking product status

The last column of the product list displays the current product status, which can be:

| **Status** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| **Published** | It indicates that the product is active and available in the store in at least one [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-trade-policies-work--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV). |
| **Pending** | It indicates that the product configuration, price or logistics information is missing for it to be available in the store.<br/><br/>When you hover the mouse over the icon indicating that the product is pending, you can see which configuration is incomplete, among **Catalog**, **Price**, or **Inventory/Shipping**. To understand what information may make the product publication pending, read the article [Why is the product not visible on the website?](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/por-que-o-produto-nao-aparece-no-site--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382) |
| **Inactive** | Indicates that the product is deactivated, hence not available for purchase.|

To view the status of a product's SKUs, read the section [Viewing the SKU List](#viewing-the-sku-list). 

## Viewing the SKU list

When you click the arrow <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> in the product row in the list, the platform displays a list with all the SKUs of that product: 

![sku-actions-en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/wv1FevJRrT0GwvKvvNb2W/06822a59851d6f677c47c4cd3d1d4230/sku-actions-en.gif)

In the SKU list, you will find the following information:

* **Status**: Current SKU status, indicated by the color icon in the SKU row. The status is the same as the one related to the product:
    * **Published:** Indicates that the SKU is active.
    * **Pending:** Indicates that it is missing some SKU configuration, pricing or logistics, information for it to be available in the store. By hovering over the icon that indicates that the SKU is pending, you can see which configuration is incomplete across **Catalog**, **Price**, or **Inventory/Shipping**.
    * **Inactive:** Indicates that the SKU is inactive, thus, not visible in the store.
* **Image:** Main image associated with the SKU.
* **ID:** Unique SKU identification code.
* **Name:** SKU name.
