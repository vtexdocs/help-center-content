If a customer chooses a language when browsing the store, it will redirect them to the URL of the desired location. After that, all Intelligent Search features will be displayed in the chosen language, according to the retailer's settings.

VTEX Intelligent Search: Multilanguage allows you to customize the search experience for each region by assigning the following search settings to specific locations:

- [Merchandising rules](#merchandising-rules)
- [Synonyms](#synonyms)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Banners](#banners)

#### Importing the Synonyms spreadsheet

If you prefer to import Synonyms for specific languages via .csv file, you must create a .csv file in __Unidirectional__ or __Bidirectional__ format, according to the [desired effect for the synonym](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3ExbC3QKNF4zH7Gs8jD1cL), and insert the new field `<comma-separated locales>`:

-	__Unidirectional__: `<comma-separated terms>;<comma-separated expanded terms>;<status>;<comma-separated locales>`
   -  For example: `smartphone;iPhone;true;en-GB`: when searching for smartphone in the English language store (`locale en-GB`), the website will return results for `iphone`. However, when searching for `iphone`, the website will not return results for `smartphone`.

- __Bidirectional__: `<comma-separated terms>;<status>;<comma-separated locales>`
    - For example: `tv,smart tv;true;en-GB`: when searching for one of these terms in the store in English (`locale en-GB`), the search results will return any product that contains one of these terms.

>⚠️ If the imported .csv file does not have the column `locale`, the synonym will be valid for all languages available in the store.
