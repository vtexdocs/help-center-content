Creating promotions is a great strategy to attract more customers to your ecommerce website. When configuring them, you must ensure that the discounts applied will produce the expected results since mistakes during the promotion creation can lead to revenue losses.

To mitigate unwanted impacts on promotions, the **Promotion Alerts** page allows you to create conditions to check if promotions are correct and to establish [preemptive actions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/alerta-de-promocoes-como-criar-um-alerta-beta--14nC51OlGoCSBLlBkZhkRR#preventive-actions) to avoid selling at unexpected prices. However, an order is required to activate the first alert.

If the defined [conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/alerta-de-promocoes-como-criar-um-alerta-beta--14nC51OlGoCSBLlBkZhkRR#conditions) are met, the system generates an alert informing you of the product sold at unexpected prices and then applies the configured [preemptive actions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/alerta-de-promocoes-como-criar-um-alerta-beta--14nC51OlGoCSBLlBkZhkRR#preventive-actions). If you configure the action of [deactivating promotions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/alerta-de-promocoes-como-criar-um-alerta-beta--14nC51OlGoCSBLlBkZhkRR#preventive-actions), the unwanted scenario will not be repeated since the promotion will have been deactivated.

Suppose you only configure the email alert action, further orders with the unwanted discount can still be placed until you manually deactivate or change the promotion settings to have the desired effect.

To access the page in the VTEX Admin, go to *Promotions > Promotion Alert*. You will see the following interface:

The table below shows the column descriptions for the promotion list:

| Column | Description | 
| ------ |:-------------:|
| Name | Promotion alert name. |
| Alert | Condition set to trigger the alert. |
| Preemptive Action | Actions that will be performed when the alert is triggered. |
| Status | Promotion status, which can be: <p><strong> Active:</strong> when the alert is active. </p> <p> <strong>Inactive:</strong> when the alert is inactive. </p> |

The Promotion Alerts page allows you to:

- [Create an alert](#creating-an-alert)
- [Search for an alert](#searching-for-an-alert)
- [Edit an alert](#editing-an-alert)
- [Deactivate an alert](#deactivating-an-alert)
- [Duplicate an alert](#duplicating-an-alert)

## Creating an alert

## Searching for an alert

To find an alert, type the promotion name in the search bar with the magnifying glass icon <i class="fas fa-search"></i> , located at the top of the page. 

The results are updated when typing a character in the search box. To clear the search, click the menu icon <i class="far fa-times-circle"></i>.
