>ℹ️ This module is in beta, which means we are working to improve it. If you have any questions, please contact <a href= "https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests">our Support</a>.

The **Promotions Simulator** allows you to view the promotions applied to shopping carts and their conditions. With several possibilities for setting up promotions, it is important to have visibility into their [competition](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-competition-of-promotions--tutorials_2270) and [combination](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-competition-of-promotions--tutorials_2270#accumulation) during purchase and how they work.

To use this feature, you need to [configure Cartman](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-o-cartman--1ACMTStZYkMqB0lTgwg451), a tool that simulates, shares, and explores carts. Once Cartman has been configured, follow the steps below to access the **Promotions Simulator**.
