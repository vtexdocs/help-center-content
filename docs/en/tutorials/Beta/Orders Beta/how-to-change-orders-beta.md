## Common aspects

When making any [type of change](#types-of-order-changes) to an order, some steps are the same, and you can check them in this section.

### Viewing details of the amount change

On the **Manage order items** page, as you change the order, the **Total amount** is automatically updated at the bottom of the page. In addition, you can view the price variation resulting from each operation. To view price details, click the arrow icon <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i> next to the total amount.

### Undoing actions

On the **Manage order items** page, you can undo a change if you want. To do this, click the curved arrow icon `Undo Action`. After this, a confirmation message will be displayed: _"Change undone"_, indicating that the action has been successfully reversed.

![change_order_undoing_actions_EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/GcSxHKn9jphCgi8eNQarG/ceee7cdae26eddb1da3588d1e5af4d0e/change_order_undoing_actions_EN.png)

## Processing errors

In any [type of order change](#types-of-order-changes) on the **Manage order items** page, when you click `Review and Apply,` the change may not be approved, which redirects you back to the order details page. Some of the reasons for changes being rejected are:

- **Unavailable item:** The SKU may [not be displayed on the store's website](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/por-que-o-produto-nao-aparece-no-site--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382) or may be unavailable due to an error or missing catalog, price, or logistics settings.
- **Insufficient inventory:** The number of items added or replaced in the change may be greater than the number of items available for sale in your [inventory](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciar-itens-em-estoque--tutorials_139).

If the Catalog and inventory settings are correct and changes to orders return errors, this might indicate a problem with the platform's processing. In this case, we recommend contacting our [support team](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).
