>ℹ️ VTEX Ad Network is in beta, which means that we are working to improve. If you are already a VTEX customer and wish to adopt this functionality for your business, please contact [Commercial Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/support-at-vtex--4AXsGdGHqExp9ZkiNq9eMy/3KQWGgkPOwbFTPfBxL7YwZ).

With [VTEX Ad Network (Beta)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-ad-network-beta--2cgqXcBuJmXN2livQvClur), VTEX stores can offer ad space in their stores for brands to promote products. VTEX will select ads for products already in your catalog, and your store will receive a fee for each ad click in your store.

To become a part of the VTEX Ad Network and start displaying ads in your store, install the VTEX Ad Network for stores app.

>⚠️ Currently, VTEX stores can only offer ad space on stores using [Store Framework](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/67SCtUreXxKYWhZh8n0zvZ#store-framework).
