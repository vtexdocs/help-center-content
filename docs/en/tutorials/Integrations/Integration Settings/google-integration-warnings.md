When integrating a VTEX store with Google Shopping, the seller must complete the [Sending products to Google Shopping](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/configurar-integracao-com-o-google-shopping--25Sl7iOqq58PGfVfTAo8Xw/5L5LnccDCj5lJk8H95GQ82) process. Google may or may not approve these products.  

## Product integration status

The integration status is an informative message about the status of the seller's products with the Google Shopping integration. You can find three categories of messages: **error messages, warning messages, and success messages.**  

To check the product integration status, go to the VTEX Admin **Marketplace > Connections > Products**, or type **Products** in the top search bar.  

The table below shows which messages belong to which status:  

| **Status** | **Message** | **Details** | **Impact on the offer** |

| **Processed with error** | **SKU from `accountName` was not integrated.** **We noticed some problems** | Inactive product or SKU, Invalid price and SKU out of stock. | If the adjustments are not made, the products will not be integrated.|
| **Processed with warning** | **SKU from `accountName` integrated. See offer. But we noticed some missing data** | EAN/UPC and manufacturer code, Size, Color, Gender and Age group. |  If applicable to the product and required data is missing, the offer may have low visibility or be rejected. |

Add following data to increase offer visibility** | [Product Highlights](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=pt-BR#zippy=%2Coutros-requisitos%2Ccomo-formatar-os-dados-do-produto:~:text=produtos%20s%C3%A3o%20veiculados.-,Opcional%3A,-envie%20o%20atributo) | If applicable and if the optional attributes indicated by Google are met, the offer can improve visibility. |
