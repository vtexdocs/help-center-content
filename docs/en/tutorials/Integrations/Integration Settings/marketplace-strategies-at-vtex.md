A marketplace is a virtual platform through which different sellers offer their products. In addition to owning products, sellers are often responsible for the [fulfillment process](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/fulfillment-logistics-vtex--53udnvI5eBy8DKo8FOjMoP).  

![Marketplace strategies](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1XaGifpW4ztfRM3XIkiACS/8f611e6a89c168b7322aa14e1f6b7024/Ecommerce_web_page-pana.png)  

[VTEX promotes digital collaboration](https://vtex.com/en-us/marketplace/) in different scenarios. For example, besides selling your products on other marketplaces, you can also act as a marketplace and sell products from other sellers on your website.  

VTEX allows you to manage everything in one place with a concept we call “one single panel”. With this unified management, you can manage your B2C catalog, pricing, inventory, and the different channels VTEX provides integration.  

Here are some of the main transactions when selling products on marketplaces:

- Inventory control in multiple channels.  
- Promotions sync.  
- Order processing.  
- Channel management.  

The product assortment sent to a marketplace is defined when you choose the [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV).  

[Additional trade policies can be requested](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X) via a ticket to our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/pt/support) team by selecting the Commercial option and the New Trade Policy request type. A monthly fee is charged for each additional trade policy, whether used for integration with certified, partner, external, or VTEX marketplaces.  

>ℹ️ Orders placed through marketplaces are subject to the same [contractual rules](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-a-vtex-considera-como-receita-para-apuracao--58j4cfoXfisWyemASACwSq?locale=pt) as the ones placed through other channels.  

Here are the scenarios we will address next:  

- [Acting as a marketplace](#acting-as-a-marketplace)  
- [Selling on marketplaces](#selling-on-marketplace)  
- [Seller Portal](#seller-portal)  

## Acting as a marketplace

VTEX's architecture allows stores hosted on its platform to offer products from other stores, whether they are VTEX stores or not. When a VTEX store starts selling products from sellers, it becomes a VTEX marketplace.  

You benefit from this relationship when your store operates as an environment where other sellers offer their products. Below are some of the main advantages of operating as a marketplace:  

- __Increase revenue:__ There are different ways to monetize an online marketplace. The most common is receiving a commission on sales made on your website.  
- __Diversify your product offering:__ Offer more products and options for your customers.  
- __Reach new customers:__ Sellers attract new customers to the marketplace, expanding your market reach and increasing your brand visibility.  
- __Improve your customer’s shopping experience:__ Diversifying and expanding your product catalog can deliver a higher-quality customer experience. As a result, your customers will be able to buy everything they need in one place (one-stop shop).  
- __Keep your costs low:__ This collaboration process does not increase your costs, as it is a scalable model that does not require investments in inventory, structure, or staff because delivering products is the sellers' responsibility.  
- __Improve your brand reputation:__ If your store is well-known in the market, customers will trust your marketplace and the products you offer on your website. In addition, you can increase your profits by offering sellers added value to their products.  

A VTEX store can sell products from other sellers by:  

- [Integrating with an external seller](#integrating-with-an-external-seller)  
- [Operating as a VTEX marketplace](#operating-as-a-vtex-marketplace)  

### Integrating with an external seller

For sellers not integrated with VTEX but want to sell their products on a VTEX marketplace, a custom connector can be developed for this integration. VTEX provides a set of APIs and instructions to facilitate the process. For more information, see our [guide for integrating with external sellers](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/external-seller-integration-guide).  

### Operating as a VTEX marketplace

The process to configure your store as [a VTEX marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-marketplace-vtex--7splyp5MqIyt2Iyz5jsNzb) does not require some of the steps required in other integrations. Once your marketplace is configured, see [Actions for a VTEX marketplace operation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/acoes-para-a-operacao-de-marketplaces-vtex--2SdIflvwywiOqCpczKCfev).  

See below for the main VTEX marketplaces:  

![mkt br](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/6DB08TtDzQ0tuesrK1I1XU/d42c1c45fff7301eea1e2fe7160274b5/mkt_br.png)

The __Marketplaces and Integrations__ module also promotes and enables contact between VTEX marketplaces and certified VTEX sellers interested in collaborations.  

## Selling on marketplaces

There are several reasons why it can be strategically advantageous to sell on a marketplace, which are:  

- __Gain visibility for your store:__ Centralizing different sellers and a wide variety of products on a single marketplace attracts user traffic. Besides, by offering your products on multiple channels, you can increase brand visibility and reach new audiences.  
- __Use a cost-effective service:__ Each marketplace has its own commercial conditions. The most common one is to pay a commission on sales. Therefore, if a seller’s products do not sell, the marketplace will charge no commissions.   
- __Increase sales:__ Operating in multiple channels diversifies your revenue streams and can increase conversion rates.  
- __Diversify your audience:__ You can define a specific product assortment for each marketplace, build market validation strategies, or make seasonal sales.  
- __Add value to your products:__ You can benefit from the trust relationship between a marketplace and its customers, especially if the audience is not familiar with your brand. This adds value to your product and can increase your conversion rates.  

### Marketplace types

There are national and international marketplaces that are great for promoting your products and boosting your sales.  

By acting as a VTEX seller, you can integrate with four marketplace types: certified, partner, external, and VTEX marketplaces.  

To integrate with a marketplace, the content linked above provides support to guide the configuration process. As a VTEX customer, you can contact our support team if you experience any issues.  

At VTEX, you can sell on other channels in the following situations:  

- [Integrating with external marketplaces](#integrating-with-external-marketplaces)  
- [Integrating with certified marketplaces](#integrating-with-certified-marketplaces)  
- [Integrating with partner marketplaces](#integrating-with-partner-marketplaces)  
- [Operating as a VTEX seller](#operating-as-a-vtex-seller)  

>ℹ️ A VTEX store can act simultaneously as a [VTEX seller](#selling-on-marketplaces) and a [VTEX marketplace](#operating-as-a-vtex-marketplces).  
> The VTEX platform offers different fulfillment features that can be combined for scenarios such as dropshipping, where the seller receives and forwards the customer's order to a third party responsible for the fulfillment. The most fitting [logistics](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/logistica--53udnvI5eBy8DKo8FOjMoP) solution for the seller will depend on the architecture and business model and can be implemented through [Back office integration (ERP/PIM/WMS)](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/erp-integration-guide).  

### Integrating with an external marketplace

If you want to sell your products on a marketplace not integrated with VTEX, you can develop a custom connector for this integration. VTEX provides a set of APIs and instructions to facilitate the process. See more details in the [guide for integrating with external marketplaces](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide).  

### Integrating with certified marketplaces

Certified marketplaces are those whose integration has been developed by VTEX's engineering team. For these integrations, the additional trade policy is exempt from the monthly fee when orders are linked to the policy via the certified marketplace. Instead, fees will be based solely on the take rate of the orders.  

>⚠️ Additional trade policies requested for integrating with certified marketplaces that are also used for integrating with other marketplace types are subject to a monthly fee.  

Currently, on the VTEX platform, you can find the following certified marketplaces:

>ℹ️ Facebook, Google Shopping, Google Shopping Ads, and TikTok are not marketplaces, but they offer a similar experience of sending products from VTEX stores.  

### Operating as a VTEX seller  

VTEX's architecture allows stores hosted in your platform to sell their products in other VTEX stores. A VTEX store that sells its products on another VTEX store is called a VTEX seller. Later in this article, you will see more information about VTEX stores offering products from VTEX sellers, acting as [VTEX marketplaces](#operating-as-a-vtex-marketplaces).  

Setting up an [integration between VTEX stores](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-seller-para-vender-em-marketplace-vtex--6g045OkRSjNpqhkExbQRlP) is simple and requires fewer steps than other integrations. You can also use the Marketplaces and Integrations module, which provides a catalog of marketplaces interested in partnerships and facilitates contact between VTEX sellers, VTEX marketplaces, and certified marketplaces.   

## Seller Portal  

The [Seller Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-primeiros-passos--6w1vBdRH2uuBGmUqgNQjwK) is a VTEX platform edition for sellers to connect and sell their products on VTEX marketplaces. The portal allows sellers to access all the key features necessary to operate ecommerce on big storefronts, increasing visibility and sales conversion.  

>ℹ️ At VTEX, it is possible to act as a [white label seller](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/definicoes-de-conta-franquia-e-seller-white-label--5orlGHyDHGAYciQ64oEgKa), a seller unknown to the consumer in his shopping experience. This type of seller is the standard for [franchise accounts](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-franchise-account--kWQC6RkFSCUFGgY5gSjdl), for example, and can be strategic for certain business models. To learn more, see the article [Choosing between standard account, franchise account, or Seller Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/escolher-entre-conta-padrao-conta-franquia-ou-seller-portal--4S90HzzhMyZESsHqrnUs78).
