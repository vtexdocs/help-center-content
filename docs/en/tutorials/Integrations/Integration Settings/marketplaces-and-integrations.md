The __Marketplaces and Integrations__ page facilitates the connection and communication between marketplaces and sellers within the VTEX ecosystem, enabling new business and mutual growth for all involved. The page works as a catalog of companies interested in partnerships, allowing registration, search, and contact between marketplaces and sellers to sign their commercial agreements.  

Among the marketplaces available, there are VTEX marketplaces and external marketplaces. Learn more about the difference between each terminology displayed in the Integration Type column.  

| **Integration Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|
| **VTEX** | These are the profiles of VTEX clients that chose to make their environment available for sellers to sell products. |
| **External** | Marketplaces that are not VTEX clients and did the integration, whether certified or partner. |  

>ℹ️ Note that **Marketplaces and Integrations** is a tool that fosters contact between potential partners, yet it is not a mandatory step in becoming a VTEX marketplace.  
> If you want to act as a VTEX marketplace, read the [Marketplace strategies at VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#sendo-seller-vtex).

## Looking for marketplaces

### __Connecting to a VTEX marketplace__  

To connect to one of the VTEX marketplaces, you need to contact VTEX to negotiate a partnership and wait for the marketplace to respond. Additionally, you must have an [active Seller Profile](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/encontre-marketplaces-e-sellers-no-ecossistema-vtex--2bzC7tXlVgLEEjxo4ixcAM#perfil-da-loja).  
When sending a message, provide all the information the marketplace needs for connecting to your business. We also suggest anticipating the questions or topics that might arise in a future meeting, for example.

 1. Click the marketplace you want.  
 2. Edit the message in the text field.  
 3. Click the __Send Message__ button.  

A success message will appear on the screen. 

If the seller needs to contact the same marketplace again, repeat the steps above.  

<div class=alert alert-info>
The potential business partner will receive an email with the information in the Message field. If the interest is mutual, the seller or marketplace can contact you to negotiate the agreement terms between the marketplace and the seller.
</div>
