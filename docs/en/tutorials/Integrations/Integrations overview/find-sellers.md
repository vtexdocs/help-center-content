The **Find Sellers** page enables contact with sellers operating in the VTEXecosystem, creating opportunities for new business and mutual growth for all involved. The page works as a catalog of parties interested in partnerships,allowing registration,search,and contact between marketplaces and sellers to sign commercial agreements.

To leverage the page,you need to create a **Store Profile**. Learn how by reading the documentation.

>ℹ️ Note that **Find Sellers** is a tool that fosters contact between potential partners,but it is not a mandatory step to be a marketplace and seller on VTEX.
> If you want to be both,a marketplace and seller,please read the [Marketplace Strategies at VTEX](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#atuar-como-marketplace) documentation.

1. In the list, click the **profile** of a potential partner.
1. Complete the **Contact Seller** field.
