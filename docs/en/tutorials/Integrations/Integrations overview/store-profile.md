VTEX provides in its Admin the **Find Sellers** and **[Marketplaces and Integrations](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/marketplaces-and-integrations--5AcBO1t29nhq7rBHas9b6V)** pages. Both aim to enable and promote communication between sellers and marketplaces operating in the VTEX ecosystem, creating new business opportunities and mutual growth for all involved.  

To contact potential partners in these lists, you need to activate your store profile as a marketplace, seller, or both on the Store Profile page in **Marketplace > Store Profile** or by typing **Store Profile** in the search bar.
