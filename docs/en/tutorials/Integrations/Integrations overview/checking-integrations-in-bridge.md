The __Integrations__ is the module responsible for managing all marketplaces used by your store. It's in this module that the registration of any new integration with marketplaces must be carried out.

In the Integrations, you can follow the integration with various active marketplaces, verifying the integration of __order__, __product__, __tracking__, __price__ and __inventory__. In addition, you can view the integration status of each item and __reprocess__ these statuses, if necessary.

## Integrations Navigation

In the Integrations, you can see the five integration tabs listed below:

1. [Orders](#orders)
2. [Products](#products)
3. [Tracking](#tracking)
4. [Price](#price)
5. [Inventory](#inventory)

In all the screens there is a __filter__, a __search box__, and an __Expand All__ button, which displays the details of each line.

You can also export a report with Integrations information by clicking the __Export to excel__ button. You can use the filter to export only the information you want.

## Orders

In the __Orders__ option, the Integrations displays the log of orders placed in the marketplaces with which your store is integrated. We have four columns that inform:

- __Order__ code.
- __Affiliate__ where the order was made.
- __Status__ of the order, which can be *successfull* or *with error*.
- __Processing date__, which indicates the last time the order was processed.

You can view more details by clicking on the order information.

In case of error, a detailed log will be displayed with the reasons why the order was not integrated. To solve these errors, you can click the __?__ button. You will be directed to [our article](/en/faq/errors-in-bridge-how-to-solve) with guidelines for solving the error. After making the corrections, you must click on the __Actions___ button and choose the __Reprocess__ option.


## Products

In the __Products__ option, the Integrations displays the log of products that have been shipped to the marketplaces with which your store is integrated. We have four columns that inform:

- SKU __code__.
- __Affiliate__ to which the SKU was sent.
- __Status__ of the sending, which can be *successfull* or *with error*.
- __Processing Date__, which indicates the last time an SKU sending was processed.

You can view more details by clicking on the SKU information.

In case of an error, a detailed log will be displayed with the reasons why the product wasn't sent to the affiliate. After making the corrections, you must click the __Actions___ button and choose the option __Reprocess SKU__.

## Tracking

In the __Tracking__ option, the Integrations displays the log of the sending of the orders made in the marketplaces in which your store is integrated. We have four columns that inform:

- __Order__ code.
- __Affiliate__ to which the SKU was sent.
- __Status__ of the trace, which can be *successfull* or *with error*.
- __Processing Date__, which indicates the last time the tracking was processed.

You can view more details by clicking on the tracking information.

In case there's an error, a detailed log of the order sending will be displayed. After making the corrections, you must click on the __Actions___ button and choose the __Reprocess__ option.

## Price

In the __Price__ option, the Integrations displays the price log of products that have been sent to the marketplaces with which your store is integrated. We have four columns that inform:

- SKU __code__.
- __Afiliado__ to which the SKU price was sent.
- __Status__ of the sending, which can be *successfull* or *with error*.
- __Processing Date__, which indicates the last time the SKU price was processed.

You can view more details by clicking on the price sending information.

In case of an error, a detailed log will be displayed on the price sending. After making the corrections, you must click on the __Actions___ button and choose the __Reprocess__ option.

## Inventory

In the __Inventorye__ option, the Integrations displays the inventory log registering the products that have been sent to the marketplaces with which your store is integrated. We have four columns that inform:

- SKU __code__.
- __Afiliado__ to which the SKU inventory was sent.
- __Status__ of the SKU inventory sending, which can be *successfull* or *with error*.
- __Processing Date__, which indicates the last time the SKU inventory was processed.

You can view more details by clicking on the inventory sending information.

In the event of an error, a detailed log of the inventory sending will be displayed. After making the corrections, you must click on the __Actions___ button and choose the __Reprocess__ option.
