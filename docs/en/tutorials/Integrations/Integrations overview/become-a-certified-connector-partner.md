The VTEX ecosystem offers countless growth opportunities. To expand its collaboration network, VTEX has developed a business plan for external marketplaces that want to become VTEX partners. 

>ℹ️ By joining a business plan, marketplaces get a certification and become certified connectors. Learn more in our [business plan](https://vtex.com/us-en/partner/).

In addition to providing a set of APIs and instructions to facilitate the integration process with our partners, our team will be available to assist you in your connector's development and homologation processes. We will ensure that you are making proper use of the features so that the integration is set correctly.

For external marketplaces with no interest in becoming a VTEX partner but that would like to integrate with VTEX stores, you can easily do it by using APIs and following our instructions. Check out more details in our [Guide for integrating with external marketplaces](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide).
