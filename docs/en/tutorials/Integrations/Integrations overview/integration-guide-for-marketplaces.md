>⚠️ Check out the updated version of this [marketplace integration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide) in our Developer Portal. 

## Marketplaces and sellers

E-commerce model between Marketplace and Seller, may stores are hosted or not on VTEX platform. Sales between Marketplace and Seller involve a negotiation between the two parts, the owner of the product (the Seller) and the owner of the showcase (the Marketplace). This negotiation usually involves commercial policy of traded items (SKUs) and maintenance of payment.

The VTEX besides offering integrations with the biggest market players, also offers a set of APIs and instructions to third parties integrate themselves. 

- _Seller_ - Responsible for accomplish the order's delivery (the owner of the product).  
- _SKU_ - Defines a variation of a product, Example: 110V white refrigerator.  
- _Marketplace_ - Showcase where the SKUs are exposed (the owner of the showcase).  
- _SLA_ - Service agreement, Example: deadline and cost of delivery.  
- _API_ - Service interfaces for communication between computer systems.

### Support tools to the integrator

### Postman

Chrome browser extension, in this tool is possible to test, store history, save access requests collections from all APIs of the VTEX modules (OMS, Logistics, Pricing, GCS, Catalog, Payments, etc.), besides it allows to export and import requests from other developers.

[[Developer] - VTEX API Collection](http://help.vtex.com/developer-docs/)

It's very important the integrator get the knowledge of this kind of tools, or other similar tools before start an integration process using the REST VTEX APIs.

### Credentials of access on the REST APIs

Every call made to REST APIs from VTEX must be made in “https” and must have in its header the authentication keys. The authentication keys of the header (to access the REST APIs) must be requested to the store administrator or to the operations team that is deploying the store.

>⚠️ **Warning**An exclusive key and token must be created to each integrator, a key from the own store mustn't be used.
