An offer is an SKU from a seller that has been sent to a sales channel and whose price and inventory have been configured.
The Sent Offers module allows sellers to monitor their offers’ submission and synchronization on all channels integrated with the store. The main page features two components that display in real-time the status of the offers and their updates based on data from the marketplace and other VTEX modules. The  components are:

- [Offers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/anuncios-enviados-beta--6yg2CBv5Z5AnD0qS0cw2sa#offers)            
- [Channels](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/anuncios-enviados-beta--6yg2CBv5Z5AnD0qS0cw2sa#channels)

## Offers

By setting up the product’s price and inventory conditions, the seller prepares it to become an offer and to be sold on the marketplace. In the *Offers* component, you can see the total number of offers, in addition to their status:

- **Sending**: intermediate state when the offer is still being submitted to the channel. This status refers to offers that: are being submitted to the marketplace for the first time; are migrating to a new channel; or have been resent after being discarded in another channel.    
- **Synched**: indicates that the offer was successfully added to a channel. It is updated by both the marketplace and the seller in real-time. The objective is to have offers correctly synched on the channel.  
- **Containing errors**: when the system detects an issue that prevents an offer from being sent or updated on a channel. This status means that the offer requires manual review.  
- **Unavailable**: when the offer is discarded for being inactive or not included in the trade policy determined for the channel.

## Channels

This component lists all channels that have been integrated and the number of offers sent, processing and containing errors on each channel. This list provides sellers with greater visibility into the health of their integrations with external channels.
