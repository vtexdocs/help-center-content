The **Offer Status** module allows sellers to track the sending and syncing of their offers on all sales channels integrated with the store. On VTEX, an offer is an SKU from a seller sent to a sales channel whose price and inventory information have been configured.  

**Offer Status** allows you to track offers sent only to VTEX marketplaces. To access the module, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Marketplace > Connections > Offer Status**, or type **Offer Status** in the search bar.

The **Offer Status** page comprises three tabs: [**Published**](#published-tab), [**Issues**](#issue-tab), and [**Awaiting Completion**](#awaiting-completion-tab), all listing your offers according to their status. You can access and view details of each offer, such as their status, inventory, price, update date, and reasons for being rejected by the marketplace.
