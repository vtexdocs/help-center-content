Inventory integration errors may occur in marketplaces for which VTEX has developed a  [native connector](/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex). As a result, the items with errors are not available on the marketplaces. In these cases, you can see a message identifying the error. To view it, log in to your VTEX Admin, go to **MARKETPLACE > Connections > Inventory**, and click on “processed with error”.

To see which inventory integration errors are most common in a given marketplace and how to solve them, click on the name of the marketplace:

- [Amazon](/en/tutorial/erros-de-integracao-de-estoque-com-a-amazon--3t05cXK2vDbKCA6rifMMWj)
- Mercado Livre (LATAM only)
- Via (Brazil only)
- Magazine Luiza (Brazil only)
- Carrefour (Brazil only)
- Netshoes (Brazil only)
