Pricing is managed in the Pricing module. Rates and promotions on the VTEX platform are taken care of in the Promotions.

Some of the advantages brought by the new price list are:

- Cost price of the products, making clear the gross profit margin.
- Rules for massive change of prices through sales policy, facilitating the management of Marketplaces prices and B2B policies.
- Pricing varying by quantity of the item, for B2B and wholeretail scenarios.
- Clearer and more intuitive interface.

The articles listed below are intended to explain in detail the process of pricing the items in your store, using the new version of the price list.

The new price list consists of: a list of products with their base prices; rules for modifying product prices according to Commercial Policies; rules for rounding up or down price; and a section on general configurations.
