The **Invoices** feature allows sellers to [filter](#filters) and export invoices for FBA orders using filters to customize searches.  

To access the page, go to the **VTEX Admin > Marketplace > Amazon > Invoices** or type **Invoices** in the search bar. The following page will open:  

![Overview Invoices Amazon](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2Mon7qB0FEIGhzTdvf0pgy/37fabf92b51716d8fd54ea81cf081ebe/overview-nfe-en.jpg)

## Filters

See below the available filters and how they work.

**Period:** Required filter. You can define a date range for extracting invoices by selecting a predefined period or setting a custom start and end date.  

> ℹ️ By default, the period displayed when accessing the page is “Today”.  

**Status:** Optional filter where one or multiple statuses can be selected, including **Issued, Rejected**, and **Canceled.** If no status is selected, all statuses will be considered in the search.

**Type:** Optional filter that allows sellers to choose between All, **Operation type**, or **Invoice type**. When **All** is selected, the search includes all invoice types. 
If **Operation type** or **Invoice type** is selected, additional filtering options are displayed :  

- If **Operation type** is selected, the options displayed include **Shipment, Excess shipment, Removal, Sales, Customer return, Found stock,** and **Lost stock,** as shown in the image below.

- If **Invoice type** is selected, the options displayed include **Shipment, Adjustment shipment, Return, Adjustment return** and **Customer sale,** as shown in the image below.

> ℹ️ If you don't select a type filter, the system returns invoices of all types by default.
