Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an authentication method that dramatically increases the security of your store's login.

During the login process, in addition to email and password, the system asks for an extra key (which, in VTEX's case, can be either an SMS or an app generated code).

Since this key is generated at login and quickly expires, it becomes almost impossible for someone to access your store using your credentials without authorization. Without 2FA, someone would only need your email and password to have full access to your store's account.

>❗ From **November 16, 2017**, 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) becomes **mandatory for all emails** that can access VTEX Admin.
>
> 
>
> Without 2FA, you **won't be able to log in** using just your email and password. This requirement only applies to email and password logins, not to other login methods (Google, Facebook and token).

## How to enable 2FA

If you have not set up 2-Factor Authentication yet, whenever you access the Admin using your email and password, a screen with 2FA configuration is displayed.

There are two authentication options:

- Using a key that's generated by an authentication app.
- Using a key sent by __SMS__.

>❗ We strongly recommend that you **choose the app authentication option**, since, with SMS authentication, you will depend on your network provider. By using an app, you can generate an access key whenever you need it.

>❗ If you chose 2FA through SMS, and the SMS code doesn't appear, your network operator is probably to blame. Use 2FA through the app, as explained below.

### Enabling 2FA through an app

To use the key generated by the authentication app:

1. Download the __Google Authenticator__ app ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) / [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=pt_BR)).

2. Use the application to scan the QR Code with your cell phone's camera.

3. Your VTEX account will be added to the application, and a 6-digit code will be displayed. Enter the code to complete your login.

  *The app code is updated periodically. No need to memorize it; access the app whenever you need an access code.*

>ℹ️ If you log in with your email and password on the same computer, the access key will be requested ** every three days**. When this happens, check the code in the application.

### Enable 2FA by SMS

To use a key sent by SMS:

1. Enter your cell phone number to receive the code by SMS - do not forget to enter the country and area code.

2. You will receive a text message from VTEX on the given cell phone. Enter the 6-digit key to finish your login.

   ![2FA - SMS Insert Code - EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/6KbuUvMFupmJEMN6kTOZ4E/80a9fe80575ca4f4a50abb040ddaea06/2FA_-_SMS_Insert_Code_-_EN.png)

>⚠️ We cannot guarantee that your network operator will be able to deliver the access key whenever necessary. If the text message does not arrive, try resending the code or <a href="#habilitate-o-2fa-per-application" >enable 2FA through the application</a>.

### 2FA for telesales operators

As some telesales operators cannot use a cell phone, VTEX users with telesales role do not need to enable 2-factor authentication.

## Changing the 2FA configuration

To change the verification settings, follow these two steps:

1. Access your user settings by clicking on the circle with your initials on the top-right corner of the Admin.

2. Click on **2-step verification** to see the settings.

3. You can then change the settings by following similar steps, as shown in the sections above, to enable 2FA through [SMS](#enable-o-2fa-by-sms) and [application](#enable-o-2fa-by-application).
