The [Order modifications](/en/tutorial/como-funciona-a-alterar-pedido-beta--56TO0bOFXsfmpc7YZ3wIUZ) feature allows you to edit an order in different ways, either due to customer requests, product unavailability, or other reasons.

This article explains how an order can be modified and how to do so. It comprises the following sections:

- [Conditions](#conditions)
- [Types of order modifications](#types-of-order-changes)
- [Common aspects](#common-aspects)
- [Processing errors](#processing-errors)

> ⚠️ To learn about the [general characteristics](/en/tutorial/how-change-order-works-beta--56TO0bOFXsfmpc7YZ3wIUZ#general-characteristics) of order modifications scenarios, including aspects like reservation, inventory update, and franchise accounts, or to understand details related to [pricing, payment, and invoicing](/en/tutorial/how-change-order-works-beta--56TO0bOFXsfmpc7YZ3wIUZ#price-changes), read the [How Order modifications works](/en/tutorial/how-change-order-works-beta--56TO0bOFXsfmpc7YZ3wIUZ) article.

## Conditions

There are some conditions for modifying orders related to the order status. See the details below.

### Status of the order to be modified

In the [order flow](/en/tutorial/fluxo-e-status-de-pedidos--tutorials_196), `Handling shipping` is the only status valid for **Order modifications** in the VTEX Admin. Read the [How Order modifications works](/en/tutorial/how-change-order-works-beta--56TO0bOFXsfmpc7YZ3wIUZ) article to learn more about API modifications.

### License Manager permission

For a user to be able to modify orders, their [role](/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc) must be associated with at least one of the following [Licence Manager resources](/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3):

## Types of order modifications

These are the main order modifications that can be made through the VTEX Admin:

- **Add:** Increase the number of items or add new products.
- **Remove:** Remove the partial or total number of items.
- **Weight change:** Adjust the weight assigned to items.
- **Replace items:** Replace items, including those priced by weight.
- **Price change:** [Change the order total amount](/en/tutorial/alterar-valor-total-do-pedido--2asq4BmxvSD8Tw9xpfZuMo).

Then click the order you want to view. If necessary, you can use [filters](/en/tutorial/filtrar-todos-pedidos--tutorials_192) to narrow your search.

### Viewing orders using the global search bar

From any VTEX Admin page, search for the order using the search bar at the top of the page. Select the `Orders` option in the right corner of the bar and use one of the following criteria:

## Common aspects

When making any [type of modification](#types-of-order-modifications) to an order, some steps are the same, and you can check them in this section.

### Viewing details of the amount modification

On the **Manage order items** page, as you modify the order, the **Total amount** is automatically updated at the bottom of the page. In addition, you can view the price variation resulting from each operation. To view price details, click the arrow icon <i class="fas fa-angle-up"></i> next to the total amount.

### Undoing actions

On the **Manage order items** page, you can undo a modification if you want. To do this, click the curved arrow icon `Undo Action`. After this, a confirmation message will be displayed: _"Change undone"_, indicating that the action has been successfully reversed.

![change_order_undoing_actions_EN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/orders/all-orders/how-to-modify-orders_6.png)

## Processing errors

In any [type of order modification](#types-of-order-modifications) on the **Manage order items** page, when you click `Review and Apply,` the modification may not be approved, which redirects you back to the order details page. Some of the reasons for modifications being rejected are:

- **Unavailable item:** The SKU may [not be displayed on the store's website](/en/faq/por-que-o-produto-nao-aparece-no-site--frequentlyAskedQuestions_382) or may be unavailable due to an error or missing catalog, price, or logistics settings.
- **Insufficient inventory:** The number of items added or replaced in the modification may be greater than the number of items available for sale in your [inventory](/en/tutorial/gerenciar-itens-em-estoque--tutorials_139).

If the Catalog and inventory settings are correct and modifications to orders return errors, this might indicate a problem with the platform's processing. In this case, we recommend contacting our [support team](https://help.vtex.com/en/support).
