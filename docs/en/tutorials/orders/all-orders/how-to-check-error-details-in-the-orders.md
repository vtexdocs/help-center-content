One of the ways of finding out details of errors in orders is using the **Show interactions** link available on the [order details page](/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-do-pedido--2Y75n54Cc9VizrlG1N6ZNl), that can be found as shown below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Orders > All Orders**, or type **All Orders** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Select the desired order.
3. On the **Order History** section, click `View Interactions`.

All interactions between the modules involved will be displayed, from the start of the order, until the final status (that is, until the status “Invoiced”).

## Useful information in Interactions

- Email or Token of the person or application that placed a given ticket.
- Email of the user who asked to cancel an order.
- Inventory reservation errors, when an order is approved and the reservation of the item has already been previously released.
- Identification of internal errors for requesting analysis by the VTEX team.
