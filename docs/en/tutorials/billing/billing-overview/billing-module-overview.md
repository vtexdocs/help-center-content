**Billing** is the page where you manage all financial aspects of your VTEX account. It is only available for users with a [Financial role](/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc). To view, edit, or perform any action on this page, please request permission from your store owner. 

To access this section, click on your **profile avatar**, which can be identified by the first letter of your email address, then click on **Billing**. Select the tab you wish to visit, such as __Contracts__, __Invoices__, __Registration Data__ and __Billing Contracts__.

> ℹ️ Only users with the access profiles of [Finance](/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy#finance), [Finance Full Access](/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy#finance-full-access) or with [Billing](/en/tutorial/recursos-do-license-manager-billing--13qKy6rwf9chc8ta90rDcy) resources linked to their access profile can view this section of the VTEX Admin.

See below for more details on the different sections and pages of this feature.

## Contracts
On the Contracts page, you will find the contracts related to your store. Some stores may have more than one contract because they have purchased multiple VTEX products and paid apps, or because they have more than one account with different environments.

## Invoices
On the [Invoices](/en/tutorial/visao-geral-do-modulo-faturas--6UxfCl4fw4GmyQwoUuIcQs#invoices) page, you can find a statement with all the payment invoices of your store, listed by month and color. In these statements, you have information on the amount, expiration date, and contract type related to the invoices. If you cannot find an invoice or if you disagree with the amounts, remember that VTEX is a postpaid service, which means that you use it first, and then the charge is generated the following month.

## Registration data
The Registration page includes the data you entered when registering your store. Here, you can also edit the general information of your store, its address, and the reseller account name.

## Billing Contacts
The data provided on the Billing Contacts page refers to the user who purchased the VTEX environment. You can edit their data and add new contacts.
