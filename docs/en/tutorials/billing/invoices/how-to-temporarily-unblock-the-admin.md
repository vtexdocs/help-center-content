The VTEX Admin is blocked when there’s a delay in paying invoices. While you settle your debts, you can temporarily unblock it for 48 business hours.

## Required permissions
To perform this procedure, you must have one of the following permissions:

- Super Admin
- [Billing role](/en/tutorial/criar-um-perfil-de-acesso-financeiro--717qPtxW3Cy9n5KrReHeVv)

## Unblock request
1. In the top bar of the VTEX Admin, click your profile avatar, indicated by the initial letter of your email address. Go to **Billing > Invoices**, or type **Invoices** in the search bar at the top of the page. 
2. Click **See how to temporarily unblock.**
3. Click **Unblock for 48 hours.**

> ℹ️ The unblock is temporary and valid for 48 business hours. Use this time to settle your invoices and avoid further blocks.
