In this article, you will find information on how to access your invoices or "boletos" (popular Brazilian off-line payment method), as they are widely known in Brazil. The way to access your invoices and more information about your account is the same, irrespective of the country where you are.

To access them you need to link a [financial role](/tutorial/como-criar-um-perfil-de-acesso-financeiro--717qPtxW3Cy9n5KrReHeVv) with all users who are authorized to have access to this information.

With an authorized financial role set, access the option *Account Setting > Billing > Invoices* to take invoices-related actions. On the next screen the available invoices will appear listed by month and color.

### The meaning of each invoice color 

- **Green**: paid invoices.
- **Purple**: invoices close to their due date.
- **Red**: overdue invoices.

We will divide the tutorial sections into *Worldwide* and *Brazil*: 

- In the *Worldwide* section which focuses on VTEX clients from **Argentina**, **Chile**, **Colombia**, **Mexico**, **the United States** and the **United Kingdom**, you will find information on how to obtain your invoice.
- In the *Brazil* section, focused on VTEX clients from **Brazil**, you will find out how to download the "boleto" and "notas fiscais".

## Brazil 

### Download "boleto" 

We recommend not overstepping due date, since a new "boleto" with penalties and taxes will need to be issued once the current one expires. 

To download your "boleto", follow the steps below: 

1. Access the **Admin**.
2. Select the **Billing** module.
3. Click on **Invoices**.
4. Select the desired invoice.
5. In the right corner of the invoice, click on **New Bank Slip**.
6. Click on **Pay this Invoice**.
7. A new "boleto" will be generated; and penalties and taxes will be included automatically when required. 

> ℹ️ In Brazil, a purple invoice can indicate that it is overdue but that a new "boleto" with an upcoming due date has already been issued. In such cases, the invoice will continue as overdue until it's paid. If no payment is made, the invoice color will switch to red again.
