> ℹ️ To terminate a contract, your store cannot have any past due debt with VTEX.Should there be any, it must be settled for the process to proceed. See [how to pay your invoice](/en/docs/tutorials/how-to-download-the-vtex-invoices).

To request the contract termination, please contact our financial team through a [ticket](/en/docs/tutorials/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support). Creating a ticket will generate a response from VTEX. After this contact, you must send the required documents. 

The required documents are: 

1. Articles of association
3. Legal representative’s data


After you submit these documents, we will send you a contract termination that must be signed and sent back to us so that we can deactivate your store environment.
