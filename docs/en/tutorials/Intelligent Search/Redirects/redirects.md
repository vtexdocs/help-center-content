The redirects feature on [Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/intelligent-search-overview--5o8ixTpYIxx3uJD0B1xp3z) directs customers to another page, either internal or external to the store. This redirection is done in the search area of your storefront, using terms or filters selected by the customer.

With this feature, you can create rules that contemplate both the interests of the manager and the final customer. See below for some of the advantages of redirects:

- Contemplating scenarios such as redirecting a search for a brand to its promotional page.
- Increasing the search possibilities for the website. Searches without results statistically generate a bounce rate, which is the percentage of visitors who enter an ecommerce website and leave without seeing other pages.
- Facilitating the end-customer's usability, as in post-purchase situations or promotional actions.

## How it works

When creating a redirect, you also need to create conditions, called rules. They must contain a set of registered terms and filters. The number of rules per redirect is unlimited. Learn more at [Configuring redirects](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-redirects--35JPufOvunMHnAAVJA6azu).

Once the customer performs a search, VTEX Intelligent Search captures the search term and checks if there is a redirection rule related to that search.

The search term is eligible when there is at least one existing rule for it. This redirects the client to the registered URL.

## Examples

If the customer searches for "my orders" or "orders", you can create a redirect that directs them to the orders in their account instead of displaying an empty search page.

You can also configure the tool to redirect the customer to a landing page for specific promotions. In this case, if the customer searches for "Black Friday", they will be redirected to the promotion.

In another scenario, if the customer searches for "running shoes" and filters for the brand Nike, they will be redirected to a dedicated page for the brand.
