>⚠️ The Autocomplete tool is enabled by default in VTEX Intelligent Search. It is not possible to disable it in the Admin.

Autocomplete is the functionality that displays previous search results based on current and previous searches. These results are presented in four different lists, which can be together or separated, depending on the customer's interaction. The existing sections are:

- Last searches performed;

- Search suggestion;

- Product suggestion;

- Most searched terms.

>⚠️ When searching for a term not listed, Autocomplete will not find products with that specification and will not display any suggestions.

During the interaction with the search bar, VTEX Intelligent Search immediately displays the set of _Most searched terms_ and _Last searches_ (if the customer has done searches before).

When the user starts typing, the system displays the _Search suggestions_ and the _Product suggestions_ and removes the previous lists.

>ℹ️ Section information <i>Most searched terms</i> and <i>Search suggestions</i> are updated daily using the data from the last 14 days of the customers' interaction with the search.

This way, it is possible to provide the customer with a more fluid and personalized search experience. They can view the result quickly and receive suggestions based on their search.

Another advantage for the store's manager is the increase in conversion due to this dynamic of usability and experience.

>ℹ️ Autocomplete offers search keyword suggestions even for completely new stores that do not yet have data on customer interaction such as clicks and searches.
>     In this case, the feature suggests search options based on an algorithm that extracts keywords from the store's catalog, products, brands, and categories.
