In “Account Overview”, Balance is the first box displayed. This section is divided into two parts: balance available and balance due. They indicate, respectively, how much you can spend at the moment and how much money will appear in your account soon.

Check the details of each below:

## How to check your balance?

To check your account balance, follow the step by step:

- Access the __VTEX Admin__;
- On the left side of the screen, click on the __VTEX Payment__ module;
- Click on __Account Overview__;
- On the left side of the screen, find the __Balance__ box.

Two different values are shown in the box. The first, __Available__, shows the account balance that is available for transactions. The second, __Balance due__, refers to future payments that will be deposited into your corporate digital account.

## How to calculate the balance due?

In the "Account Overview" section, retailers can find their store’s Balance due. This value represents the sum of all future payments from sales they already made.

Suppose that the retailer has a total of three unpaid sales, of 100.00 USD, 200.00 USD and 300.00 USD, which will be paid in that order. Therefore, the balance due will be the sum of these amounts: 600.00 USD.

When the first amount (100.00 USD) is paid, the balance due will be 500.00 USD, and the balance available will increase by 100.00 USD.
