The first step is to check if your account has an available balance for this type of transaction.

There are two ways to check this. The first one is through the Anticipation page in the Admin.

It's simple:

1. Access the __VTEX Admin__;
2. Click on the __VTEX Payment__ module;
3. Then click on __Account Overview__;
4. In the “Upcoming sales receipts” box, click on the __“Anticipate”__ button;
5. Under the "Desired value", check the __amount__ informed in __"Available to anticipate"__.

Now that you have checked the balance, it is important to keep in mind that the minimum amount to be anticipated is the lowest receivable from the store.

For example, if your lowest receivable is R$ 10, this is the minimum amount you can anticipate. The maximum amount is informed in the Admin’s “Anticipate receivables” page - the balance you just checked.

>ℹ️ **Warning**: receivables in dispute or expected for the next business day cannot be anticipated.

Check out the step by step to request the anticipation:

1. Access the __VTEX Admin__;
2. On the left side of the screen, click on __VTEX Payment__;
3. Click on __Account Overview__;
4. In the “Upcoming sales receipts” box, click on the __“Anticipate”__ button;
5. Check the __available balance__;
6. Enter the __amount__ in the "Desired value" field;
7. Click on the __“Simulate”__ button.

Then, the Admin will show you an anticipation proposal, in which you can check:

- The __rates__ involved;
- The __payment date__ of the net receivable;
- __Balances__ - both the available amount in your account and the total of receivables.

After validating the proposal information, click on the “Confirm anticipation” button.

Finally, you will see the anticipation status - whether it was successful or not.

The anticipated amount will be credited to your account from 4:00 pm on the next business day. If the anticipation is requested on a Friday, for example, the customer will receive it on Monday afternoon.

If you want to return to the Admin, click on the “Close” button.
