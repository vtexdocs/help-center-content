An __account name__ is your business identification on the VTEX system. 

Just like the business name (which is how your customers know your brand), the __account name__ is how the system recognizes your business and processes your information, settings, and stores that are linked to it.

In other words, the __account name__ identifies your account in VTEX and allows you to set up your stores. To do this, you must first define the [__store names__](/en/tutorial/what-is-the-store-name) action which is performed in the [Account management](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/account-details-page--2vhUVOKfCaswqLguT2F9xq) page.

With your account name setted and at least one store name created (each account name can have multiple store names linked to it), you may already put your store live. 

All you have to do is create a [web site](/en/tutorial/how-to-create-a-web-site) for it and perform what we call [binding](/en/tutorial/what-is-binding). 

This process is nothing more than establishing a link between a web site, a __store name__ and a trade policy. It is essential to make your store available.
