The logo on the payment slip is the same image used as the store logo, in other words, it is stored in the account configurations.

To change the registered logo, follow the step-by-step procedure below:

1. Click on your profile avatar, which can be identified by the first letter of your email address.
2. Click on **Account settings.**
3. Click on **Account.**
4. Go to the **Company information** section and click **Edit.**
5. At the **Logo** section, click **Upload.**
6. Select the image.
7. Click on **Save.**

The image will be changed when the next payment slips are generated.
