After all phases of the project have been completed, the URL will finally be ready to go online, and you can start selling! To do so, you must make some mandatory settings to enable the correct access of the link to its environment.

The first step is to validate the store, confirming that all the necessary steps have been completed and are correct for the store to go online. [Know how to validate the store](http://help.vtex.com/tutorial/validacao-de-loja/ "Know how to validate the store").

Second, you must set up DNS pointingÂ [according to this tutorial](/en/tutorial/configuring-dns-pointing-to-vtex).

Then, you have to place your store on a production status on its relevant License Manager. The step-by-step process is simple, and is described below:

1. Access the **Account Management** module;
2. Click on the **Accounts** tab;
3. Click on the name of your store;
4. On the option **Is it n production, **click on the **No button**, to change it to **Yes**;
5. Click on the **Save** button.

After this is set up, the access to the final URL of the store will be redirected to your e-commerce!
