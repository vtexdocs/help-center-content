The **Account Management** is the module responsible for managing users, authorizations and other basic data of your VTEX account.

## Overview

In this section it is possible to preview the Roles as well as the Users registered in the module.

## Roles

Within this submodule, authorization groups are created to be granted to store users.

VTEX offers a number of existing profiles, which usually meet most needs, but it is always possible to have a new, fully customized profile. Find out more about [roles](/en/tutorial/configuring-access-profiles/).

## Users

This is the submodule where we register those who can access the administrative environment of the virtual store, also creating the authorizations – which may be viewed or modified. Find out more about the [register of users](/en/tutorial/managing-users/).

## Accounts

Here we find some basic data about your virtual store, domain and multi-domain configurations, access keys for APIs, the company logo and contact information. Some of this data is used solely for VTEX, and may not reflect changes to the data displayed in the store.
