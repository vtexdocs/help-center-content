To [access invoices](/tutorial/como-acessar-o-valor-da-receita-aprovada--tutorials_4322#relatorio-financeiro) and other financial information in your account, you need to associate a financial role with all users authorized to view this information.

There are two predefined financial [roles](/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc): [Finance](/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#finance) and [Finance Full Access](/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#finance-full-access). We will use the Finance role as a reference for this article, but the steps detailed below are the same for both roles.

## How to associate users with the financial access profile

9. Click  **Account settings**.  
10.  Click **User Roles**.  
11.  Click `New Role`.  
12.  Select the **Finance** profile.  
13.  Add users to this access profile.  
14.  Click `Save`.

The financial access profile is now created and available to be associated with existing users.
