To [access invoices](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/como-acessar-o-valor-da-receita-aprovada--tutorials_4322#relatorio-financeiro) and other financial information in your account, you need to associate a financial role with all users authorized to view this information.

There are two predefined financial [roles](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc): [Finance](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#finance) and [Finance Full Access](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#finance-full-access). We will use the Finance role as a reference for this article, but the steps detailed below are the same for both roles.

## Creating a financial role

To create a financial role, follow the walkthrough below:

1. Open the **Admin**.
2. Access the **Account Management** module.
3. Click on the **Roles** tab.
4. Click on the **New Role** button.
5. Select the **Finance** role.
6. (Optional) Before saving, you can **add users to this role**.
7. Click on **Save**.

After you’ve created the financial role, you can associate it with your existing users.

## Associate users with the financial role

To associate a user with the Finance role you’ve created, follow the steps below:

1. Open the **Admin**.
2. Access the **Account Management** module.
3. Click on the **Users** tab.
4. Select the user you want to associate with the role.
5. Choose the **Financial role**.
