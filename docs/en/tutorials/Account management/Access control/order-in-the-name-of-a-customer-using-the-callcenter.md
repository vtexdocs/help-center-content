To provide access to the callcenter operators, you have to [allocate them the callcenter role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-can-i-create-callcenter-user) (televendas) using the License Manager module.

The toolbar appears once the registered operator logs on to the store environment and it is displayed in every area of your site (except for Meus Pedidos).

To order in the name of a customer using the callcenter, the operator needs to click on **Login as**, in the right-hand corner of the toolbar.

Having done this, the customer’s e-mail is displayed in this same area.

To log on as another user, just click on the **Change customer** button.
