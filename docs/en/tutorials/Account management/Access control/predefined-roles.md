## Admin - Start page only

This is the basic role that grants access to the home page of the administrative environment. It is the minimum required for a user not to be received with an error message when logging into the administrative environment.

Resource table:

| Resource name | Product | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Homepage | Catalog | Administration | Home page |
| Help page | Catalog | Administration | Help home page |

## Call center operator

This is a role dedicated to telesales operators, as it grants access to VTEX's [telesales features](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/telesales-features--UqhiccIRIK2KD0OqkzJaS) and allows you to view orders.

The Assisted Sales resource causes the user to be automatically redirected to the store's telesales page, which will leave the user logging into an account with this role without access to important features of the administrative menu.

We therefore recommend using two separate accounts (with different emails) for telesales users: one account for the __Call center operator__ role (with the *Assisted Sales* and *View order* resources) and another account for carrying out operations in Admin, if necessary.

>⚠️ When creating a [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#), avoid including call center [resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3#) with other resources. Otherwise, the role might not work as expected.

Resource table:

| Resource name | Product | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assisted Sales | Catalog | Telesales | Telesales features. After the login, the user is redirected to the telesales site www.{storename}.com.br/a/telesales. This way, the operator can use telesales features such as navigating the store in the name of the customer.As this feature causes an automatic redirect to the store, the user who logs in an account with this resource in their role will not have access to important resources from Admin. |
