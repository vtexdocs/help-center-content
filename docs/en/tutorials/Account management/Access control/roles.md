The **Roles** page in the VTEX Admin allows you to manage the [roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/access-control--4rM3gyiWqtkim4Q8hOvLTC#roles) added to your store and the users associated with them. To access it, in the top bar of the VTEX Admin, click your profile avatar — indicated by your email initial letter — and then click **Account settings** > **Roles**.

From the **Roles** page, you can do the following:

* [Create a role](#creating-a-role)
* [Search for a role](#searching-for-a-role)
* [Edit a role](#editing-a-role)
* [Delete a role](#deleting-a-role)

![roles-en](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/hn5I8XMFI38UCoMxIIjjM/d0c8e68b433a987fb1d0c9f031726d6f/roles-en.png)

The page displays a list of all roles added to the account and their respective information in a table:

| **Column** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Name that identifies the role. |
| **Users** | Number of users with this role. |
| **Role Type** | Type of role, which can be __Predefined__ or __Custom__. For more information on each type, see [Role types](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/access-control--4rM3gyiWqtkim4Q8hOvLTC#role-types). |
| **Products** | License Manager products included in the role. See the available products in the __Product__ column of the table in [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/recursos-do-license-manager--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3). |
| **Created Date** | Date on which the custom role was created. For roles predefined or created before December 2023, no date is displayed in this column. |

In a newly created account, only the *Owner (Admin Super)* role will be listed. This role gives the user unrestricted access to all native resources of the platform.

>⚠️ The number of users with the *Owner (Admin Super)* role should be as few as possible. In addition, make sure there is visibility and control over who is granted this access.

## Creating a role

To create a new role, click `+ Create Role`. For details on how to complete the form, read [Creating roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-roles--qGtNQpKSSAduX94l2WZBW).

## Searching for a role

You can search for a role by entering part of its name in the search bar. The list of results will be updated in real time.

## Editing a role

You can edit the resources and users associated with a role. To do so, click ⫶ in the row of the role you want to edit, and then click <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i> `Edit`.

## Deleting a role

To delete a role, click `⫶` in the row of the role you want to delete, and then click <i class="far fa-trash-alt"></i> `Delete`.

>⚠️ By deleting a role, users associated with that role will lose access to the [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/entutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) from the deleted role, unless they are also assigned other roles with the same permissions.
