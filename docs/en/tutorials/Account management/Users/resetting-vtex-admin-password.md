2. Click `Forgot password`. An access code will be sent to your email address.
3. Go to your email and copy the access code you received.
4. Go back to the VTEX Admin login screen and paste or type the access code in the **Code** field.
5. Enter the new password, which must have at least:

   * 8 characters  
   * 1 number
