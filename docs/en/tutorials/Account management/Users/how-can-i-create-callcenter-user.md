This article explains how to register a user with the telesales [role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc). For more information on roles and how to configure them, please read the article [Roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc).

## Telesales roles

By using telesales roles, the retailer can give access permissions to users in the telesales department.

When a telesales user logs in, they are redirected to the telesales website and can perform operations in the store on behalf of the end customer.

## Creating a telesales user

To create a user with the telesales role, follow the steps below.

1. Click on **Account management** > **Roles**.

2. Click on the **New Role** button.

3. From the **Choose role** menu, select **Call center operator** or **Call center operator (restricted order views)**. The first role gives access to all orders, and the second role gives access only to orders created by the user.

4. In the field **Add users for this role**, enter the email address of the user to whom you want to assign the telesales role.

5. Click on the **Add** button.

6. If you want to add more users, repeat steps 4 and 5.

7. Click on **Save**.
