The user management with access to the administrative environment of your VTEX store is done through the [Account settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/account-settings-overview--6USYxLuzNt4uAkvjdPF7I8), in the **Users** page. To access the page, click on your **profile avatar** on the VTEX Admin top bar, marked by the initial of your email, and click on **Account settings** > __Users__ .

This page displays the list of users with their __Name__, __Email__ and __MFA__ configuration. There are also options to search for users, export users and create new ones. Other options available on this interface are to edit or delete each user.

>⚠️ Any user that wants to manage users or application keys must have a profile with the **Save User** [resource](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3?&utm_source=autocomplete). You can use the default profile [User Administrator - RESTRICTED](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy#user-administrator-restricted), for example.

## Creating a new user

1. Click on your **profile avatar** on the VTEX Admin top bar, marked by the initial of your email, and click on **Account settings** > __Users__ .
2. Click on the `+ New` button.  
3. Fill in the **Email**.

6. Click on `Add roles` to confirm the selection.
7. Click on `Save`.  

The user will receive an email confirming the information was received, with a link to register the password.
