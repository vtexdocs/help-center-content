The creation of credentials for integrations with the Web Service must be done by License Manager, with the functionality of appKey and appToken.

For the creation of these keys, see the article [Creating appKeys and appTokens to authenticate integrations](/en/tutorial/creating-appkeys-and-apptokens-to-authenticate-integrations)

The keys must be allowed to the __WebService__ access profile.

In the context of Web Service, the user is the appKey and the password is the appToken.

To access the Web Service the URL `https://webservice-ACCOUNTNAME.vtexcommerce.com.br/service.svc?wsdl` must be used.
