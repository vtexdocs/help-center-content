The user screen allows you to configure your access data for the VTEX Admin.

To access it, follow the steps below:

2. Select the __User Settings__ option.

There are two menu options:

- In __Personal__, you can see your name, your e-mail that is used in the Admin, and you can also edit your phone number.

- In __Authentication__, you can find the password options, 2-factor authentication (2FA) for your VTEX Admin login and session management. See the options in detail below.

## 2-step verification

By clicking on __2-step verification__ you have access to two options: __SMS Code__ and __Google Authenticator App__. See how to configure the 2-step verification in the article on how to [Enable login by 2-factor authentication](/en/tutorial/highlogin-by-2-factor authentication).

### SMS Code

Here you can add the phone number to which the authentication code should be sent to.

You only need to enable this setting if you wish to receive the authentication code by SMS.

### Google Authenticator App

Here you must configure the application that will provide the authentication key.

See in detail how to configure the application in the article on [Enabling two-factor authentication login](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/habilitar-login-por-autenticacao-de-2-fatores#habilitar-o-2fa-por-aplicativo).
