The **B2B Organizations** app allows you to group B2B users into organizations. You can assign specific payment methods, price lists, and product collections to each organization, allowing all users in the organization to share the same commercial conditions. Each organization is segmented into one or more cost centers, each with its own shipping address.

## Accessing a buyer organization

To access a buyer organization in the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps > B2B Organizations and Cost Centers > Organizations**, or type **Organizations** in the search bar at the top of the page.

To access an organization, follow these steps:

1.	Click the **Organizations** tab.

2.	Click the name of the desired buyer organization.

This section lists all the organizations created in your store, their status, and allow store admins to:

- Add new organizations.

- Access the organization details page, which comprises organization data, cost centers, collections, payment terms, price lists, and users.

## Organization Status

In the **Status** column in the Organizations tab, you can see the status of the organization.

You can use the search bar to find organizations by name or filter organizations by status.

Each organization can have one of the following status:

- **Active:** The organization has been approved by store admins and is currently active.

- **On hold:** The organization is currently paused, which means that its users cannot complete purchases.

- **Inactive:** Store admins have deactivated the organization, so your users won't be able to log in.
