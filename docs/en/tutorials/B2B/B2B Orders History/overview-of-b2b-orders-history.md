In a [B2B operation](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/b2b-visao-geral--5vb9SNXhX2bZnkpAh7ADdC), multiple users from the same organization place orders on behalf of the company. The **B2B Orders History** app was developed to meet these specific needs, allowing users to view and manage orders in an integrated and collaborative way.

## Feature
The **B2B Orders History** app replaces the standard Orders page in [My Account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-my-account-works--2BQ3GiqhqGJTXsWVuio3Xh) with a version tailored to the B2B scenario. This customization allows logged-in [users](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/gerenciamento-de-permissoes-no-b2b-suite--2PLR7mIFxgbmsGq84paLeA) of an organization to view their orders and access orders placed by other members of the same organization or cost center, provided they have the necessary permissions.

## Advantages
A centralized view of orders is important to:

- Allow all authorized members of the organization to monitor their orders, avoiding duplication and errors.
- Facilitate order management, ensuring all orders comply with company policies.
- Provide quick and easy access to orders, improving operational efficiency and facilitating decision-making.
