The **B2B Quotes** app allows customers using the [B2B Organizations](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/gerenciamento-de-organizacoes-b2b--1UwNCWhML3BsV6anpoUvVZ) app to request quotes for their shopping carts and save them for future use, including items, quantities, and prices. This facilitates price negotiations with the store's sales associates and order approval flows within the organization.

## Creating quotes or saving carts
To create a quote or saved cart, you must have the [Create Quotes and Carts permission](#create-quotes-and-Carts-permission). After adding products to the cart, use the cart content to create a saved cart or request a quote. Follow the instructions below:

<ol>
   <li>
      Add products to the shopping cart.
      <ul>
         <li>Click <strong>Create Quote</strong> in the shopping cart.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Go to the storefront and click <strong>Hello, {username}</strong>. Click <strong>My Account</strong>.
      <ul>
         <li>Click <strong>Quotes and Saved Carts</strong> in the sidebar.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Click <strong>New Quote</strong>.</li>
   <li>Access the <code>/b2b-quotes/create</code> route.</li>
   <li>Enter the name of the quote or the saved cart.</li>
   <li>
      Make sure that all the information on the Create Quote page is correct:
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Original Subtotal:</strong> Shopping cart subtotal not considering discounts.</li>
         <li><strong>Percentage Discount:</strong> Percent of the discount given by a sales associate.</li>
         <li><strong>Quoted Subtotal:</strong> Subtotal of the quote with discounts given by sales associates.</li>
         <li><strong>Image:</strong> Image of the selected product.</li>
         <li><strong>Ref. Code:</strong> Reference code of the selected product.</li>
         <li><strong>Name:</strong> Product name.</li>
         <li><strong>Original Price:</strong> Original price of the product.</li>
         <li><strong>Quoted Price:</strong> Product price considering the discounts given by sales associates.</li>
         <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Number of items.</li>
         <li><strong>Total:</strong> Total amount considering the quoted price and the number of items.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Write a note in the <strong>Add Note</strong> field, if necessary.</li>
</ol>
>ℹ️ Notes added here will be visible as part of the Update History of the quote or saved cart and can be seen by the sales associates or other members of your organization and cost center. For example: if a user wants to ask for a specific discount from the sales associate in the B2B store, they can enter this request as a note.
<ol start="8">
   <li>
      Click one of the following options:
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Save for Later:</strong> Creates a saved cart. The status of the newly created saved cart will be set to <strong>Ready</strong>, which means that it can be used immediately in an order by any user within that organization or cost center who has the <a href="#">permission</a> to Create Orders from Quotes and Carts.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Save Quote:</strong> Creates a quote. The status of the newly created quote will be set to <strong>Pending</strong>, which means that it will need to be reviewed and adjusted by a sales associate before any special discounts can be applied.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ol>

A quote is essentially a saved cart with the original quantities and prices of the items in the user's shopping cart.

## Quote details
The Quote Details page displays all the information about a quote or saved cart, as well as the actions available based on the status and [user permissions](#access-permissions). To access this page, go to **My Account > Quotes and Saved Carts**.

On this page, you will see the following information:

- **Name:** Reference name of the quote or saved cart.
- **Original Subtotal:** Shopping cart subtotal without discounts.
- **Percentage Discount:** Percent of the discount given by a sales associate.
- **Quoted Subtotal:** Subtotal of the quote with discounts given by sales associates.
- **Expiration:** Expiration date of the quote or saved cart, in `MM/DD/YYYY` format.
- **Status:** Current status of the quote or saved cart, as displayed on the **My Quotes page**.
- **Image:** Image of the selected product.
- **Ref. Code:** Reference code of the selected product.
- **Name:** Product name.
- **Original Price:** Original price of the product.
- **Quoted Price:** Product price considering the discounts given by sales associates.
- **Quantity:** Number of items.
- **Total:** Total value considering the price quoted and the number of items.
- **Update History:** Includes a history of all events related to the quote, such as its creation and discounts given, including notes, if any.
- **Add Note:** Optional field for writing comments or notes. Notes added here will be visible as part of the Update History of the quote or saved cart. For example, if a user wants to ask for a specific discount from the sales associate, they can enter this request as a note.

![Quotes Details - EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5XLea07XtuCRfGJyvX819I/3f0a860131ed34dfac7c3d0089c1a00d/Quotes_details.png)

## Editing quotes
Users with [editing permissions](#access-permissions), usually associated with sales or store administrator roles, can edit quotes on the Quote Details page as follows:

- **Edit the price or quantity of each SKU:** Edit directly in the **Quoted Price** and Quantity columns of the product list within the quote.
- **Apply Percentage Discount:** Apply a percentage discount to the quote by dragging the discount bar to the desired percentage. This will override any changes made to individual product prices.
- **Expiration Date Change:** Change the expiration date of the quote.
- **Add Note:** Write a comment (optional).

After editing the quote details page, save the quote by clicking `Save Quote`. This will set the status of the quote to **Ready** and notify all users who have previously interacted with the quote of the change by email.

## Requesting additional adjustments to a quote
Users without editing permissions, but with [access permissions](#access-permissions), can add additional notes to a quote or cart unless its current status is **Ready**, **Pending** or **Reviewed**.

When a sales associate adjusts and saves a quote, the status changes to **Ready**. Then, a member of the organization can add notes and click **Send to Sales Associate**, changing the status to **Reviewed**. This allows the member of the organization to request additional adjustments to prices or quantities.

## Rejecting a quote or saved cart

Users with the [permission](#access-permissions) to **Reject** Quotes and Carts can reject a quote or saved cart if the current status is **Ready**, **Pending** or **Reviewed** by clicking `Decline` on the quote details page. A declined quote or saved cart can no longer be edited or used in an order.

## Using a quote or saved cart in an order
 Users with [permission](#access-permissions) to place **Orders** from Quotes and Carts can use a quote or saved cart in an order if the current status is **Ready**, **Pending** or **Reviewed**.

To use the quote, click `Use Quote` on the quote details page. You will be redirected to checkout, with the content of the quote or saved cart added to your current cart. All items that were previously in your cart will be removed.

>⚠️ If the [ Checkout Settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/b2b-checkout-settings--u7wG1SjmeCqXCSF2UsVok) app is installed, the checkout will be blocked until you place the order. This means that you won't be able to edit product quantities or add or remove new products. If there are not enough items in stock to meet the quantity specified in the quote or saved cart, the system will automatically adjust the quantity. If a product is not available, the checkout will allow you to remove it from the cart.

After placing the order, the status of the quote or saved cart will automatically change to **Placed**, preventing its further use.
