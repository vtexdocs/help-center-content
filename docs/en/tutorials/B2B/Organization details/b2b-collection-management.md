In a B2B operation, the collection feature allows administrators to group specific products together, making it easier to manage offers, promotions, and commercial conditions tailored to different organizations.

By assigning collections to an organization, you make sure that specific product groups will be available based on the organization's business needs, optimizing the shopping experience and product management.
