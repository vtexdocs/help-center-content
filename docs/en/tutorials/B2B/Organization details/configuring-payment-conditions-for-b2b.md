In a B2B operation, [payment conditions](https://help.vtex.com/es/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455?&utm_source=autocomplete) are assigned to the buying organization. You determine the payment options that the organization users see at checkout.

An organization administrator user can customize the available payment options by cost center.

>ℹ️ When you configure a payment condition in the Payments module, it will display as a payment method in the **Available** list in the **Payment Conditions** tab.
