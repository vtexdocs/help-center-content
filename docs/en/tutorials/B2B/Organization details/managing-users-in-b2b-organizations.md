In a VTEX B2B operation, users are those authorized to access the platform within a B2B organization. They can:
- Place orders.
- Manage information.
- Perform administrative tasks.

The **Users** tab in the VTEX Admin is essential for managing who can access and operate the platform on behalf of an organization. Defining users and their permissions ensures secure operations, consistent with the responsibilities and roles of each organization member.

See how you can manage users by:
- [Adding new users to the organization](#adding-new-users-to-the-organization).
- [Editing users](#editing-users).
- [Removing users](#removing-users).
