In an organization, the Organization Admin (main user) manages access for different people in a B2B store. To do this, they use the permission system in B2B Suite.

Through this app, you can do the following:

- **Initial configuration:** The admin creates the predefined roles and assigns their permissions.

- **Associate roles and permissions:** Predefined roles are associated with different functions and responsibilities within the organization, each with specific permissions.

- **Sync automatic information:** The app automatically communicates with other B2B Suite apps, such as [B2B Organizations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.b2b-organizations), to enable different organization management capabilities based on each user role.

- **Check permissions:** When a user performs an action in the store, such as placing an order or accessing certain features, the app checks if the user has the necessary permissions based on their assigned role.

- **Manage permissions:** The app operates backstage and stores predefined roles.

## Roles and permissions

The Storefront Permissions app allows that within an organization, each user can have different roles. For example, a buyer who places orders with budget limits from a predefined cost center or a manager in charge of reviewing and approving orders. These roles can be associated with multiple permissions, depending on the actions the user needs to perform.

## Roles

The following table shows the roles available, along with their keys and descriptions.
