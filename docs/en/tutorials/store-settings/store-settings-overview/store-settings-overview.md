**Store Settings** are the configurations applied to your store, storefront and how your end customers interact with your ecommerce. We have grouped all settings applied to your store under the __Store Settings__ section on the left navigation menu. That is where you can access settings applied to Payments, Orders, Email Templates, Shipping, Product, Storefront, Channels and Intelligent Search. 

To access this feature, click __Store Settings__ on the left navigation menu, and click on the desired section.

> ⚠️ Note that the settings you had configured in the previous environment have not changed. We have only rearranged how you reach them.
