Security Monitor is a dashboard that helps merchants identify and manage potential risks in their environment in real time. The tool identifies configuration risks and the behavior of admin users, then notifies merchants via email, enabling them to take preventive action against security vulnerabilities.

To access the dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Dashboards**, or type **Dashboards** in the search bar.
2. Under **Security Monitor**, click **Security Monitor Dashboard**.

Security Monitor displays the findings in three tabs based on their status:

- [Open](#open)
- [Snoozed](#snoozed)
- [Closed](#closed)

In all tabs, you can:

- [Search for findings](#searching-for-findings)
- [Filter findings by type](#filtering-findings-by-type)
- [Edit notification settings](#editing-notification-settings)

Below, you will find specific details about the information available in each tab and their related actions.

## Open

The **Open** tab displays the threats detected by the Security Monitor that have not yet been managed or snoozed.

The top bar displays the total number of findings and the number of threats by severity level (high, medium, or low).

![2-findings-en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_2.png)

The tab displays the full list of open findings in a table, from the most recent to the oldest:

2. Select `Manage`.

   You will be redirected to the **Users** screen in **Account Management** to edit the roles associated with the specific user or application key.

### Snoozing findings

To move a finding to the **Snoozed** tab, removing it temporarily from the **Open** tab, follow the instructions below:

1. In the finding row, click the ⋮ menu.
2. Select  `Snooze`.
3. Choose the number of days you want the finding to remain in the **Snoozed** tab. The options available are: **7**, **90**, or **120** days.
4. Click `Snooze`.

![3-snooze-finding-en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/_3.png)

## Snoozed

The **Snoozed** tab lists the findings that have been snoozed in a table, with the same information as described in the [Open](#open) tab.

In the **Snoozed** tab, the actions menu in each finding's row only displays the `Unsooze` option, which allows you to undo the snooze action and send the finding back to the **Open** tab.

The **Closed** tab displays a list of findings that have been managed and are therefore closed. It displays the following information in a table:
