As a merchant, it's crucial to be aware of scams that might misuse the VTEX brand in fraudulent ways. In this article, we'll share some recommendations to help you identify and avoid these scams.

Protecting your online store from scams using the VTEX brand requires constant vigilance and caution. By following the guidelines in this guide and staying alert to potential threats, you will be contributing to the security and integrity of your online business.

## Verify the authenticity of the communication

VTEX generally communicates with its clients through official channels:

- Pop-up messages in the VTEX Admin
- Business emails
- Announcements in the [Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/) or[ Developer Portal](https://developers.vtex.com/)
- Posts on the official VTEX [website](https://vtex.com/us-en/) or social networks

Be wary of any communication requesting confidential information or suspicious actions, especially from unverified sources.

Scammers often try to convince you to act immediately, giving you a short deadline or suggesting there's a risk involved. So stay calm and always think before clicking or providing any information.

## Protect login credentials

Keep [application keys](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet), [user tokens](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-user-tokens), and VTEX [login](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/authentication--21CkKHLKP1o41lUpGhuRUs#login) credentials such as email, password, and access codes safe. Never share personal and confidential information, store data, codes, or any other sensitive information with third parties.

Scammers may try to get access to your account to perform fraudulent activities on behalf of your company. Before taking action or providing any information, ensure that the communication is indeed from VTEX.

## Identify misleading offers

If you receive offers claiming to be part of an incentive program in VTEX's name, do not follow the sender's instructions. VTEX does not offer incentive programs or request payments from individuals or companies outside the platform's service agreement terms.

Always check the URL before clicking a link or accessing a page to make sure it is one of VTEX's [official communication channels](#verify-the-authenticity-of-the-communication). If you have any questions, contact our [Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/faq/how-does-vtex-support-work--3kACEfni4m8Yxa1vnf2ebe) team.

Familiarize yourself with these resources and use them to strengthen your store's security. Learn more about our security practices in [Security - VTEX](https://vtex.com/us-en/security/).
