__Render__ is a React-based, always-live web framework that runs on the VTEX IO platform. Developers use the __VTEX Toolbelt CLI__ to sync files and write code, not configuration. This allows out-of-the-box support for HMR, SSR, minification, code splitting, HTTP/2, WYSIWYG editing and 30-second deploy.

Render sites are composed from __Apps__ that expose React Components and may depend on other apps or any npm module. Non-technical users can compose multiple apps on extension points or create new routes from scratch. These configurations generate new builds under the hood, so everything stays optimized.

## Main features

By controlling the build and rendering cycles, we are able to deliver some great features out-of-the-box like server-side rendering, minification, code splitting by route, tree shaking, HTTP/2 support and CDN distribution.
