Workspaces are, as the name says, work spaces isolated from each other, in a way that changes in one workspace do not affect the work done in the others.

This means that you can test your changes without any risk of interfering with live apps or with the work of other developers.

It works as a version of the account, in a way that any development operation is done on a specific workspace, separate from other workspaces as explained previously. If you're used to working with GitHub, think of workspaces as branches.
