To start developing, you should create a development workspace. To do this, type the following:

`vtex workspace create {name}`

- `{name}` should be replaced with the name you want to give the workspace.

You can also simply use the following command to switch to the new workspace: `vtex use {name}`. The system will identify that it doesn't exist yet and will ask if you wish to create it. Confirm, and you will be automatically taken to the new workspace.
