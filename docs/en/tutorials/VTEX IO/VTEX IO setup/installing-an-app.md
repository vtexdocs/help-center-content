Once your app is [published](/en/tutorial/publish-the-app-to-the-current-accounts-registry), you should follow the steps below:

1. Create a new workspace
2. Switch to this workspace
3. Install your app 

To [install](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-does-installing-an-app-mean) an app, use one of the following commands:

- `vtex install` if you are currently in the app's folder
- `vtex install {appVendor}.{appName}` to install the latest version of the app
- `vtex install {appVendor}.{appName}@{appVersion}` to install a specific version of the app

Then put the workspace in [production mode](/en/tutorial/moving-a-workspace-to-production-mode).
