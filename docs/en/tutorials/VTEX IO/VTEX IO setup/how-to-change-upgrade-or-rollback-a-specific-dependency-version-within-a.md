Sometime during your app's development process, you might face the need to alter the version of a specific dependency inside a workspace.  This is especially useful when troubleshooting for errors by forcing a rollback.

To obtain a list of all of your app's dependencies and their respective versions inside a workspace, execute the following command:

`vtex deps ls -k`

To change versions, execute the command like so:
`vtex deps update vtex.{NomeDaDependencia}@<version>`

The command would look like this for example:
`vtex deps update vtex.styleguide@7.6.7`
