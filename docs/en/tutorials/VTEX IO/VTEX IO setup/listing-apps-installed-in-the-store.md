To list apps installed in the store, use the command below:

`vtex list`

You will see a table with the following columns:

- __Vendor__: the app developer. It can be an agency, VTEX itself or any other subscription.
- __Name__: name of the app.
- __Version__: version of the app.
- __Linked__: whether or not the app is linked.

There are no limits for apps that can be created for an account.
