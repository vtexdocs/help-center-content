The first step to develop in VTEX IO is to install our CLI (command line interface). One way to do this is through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

So if you do not have npm installed on your computer, just download it at [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and follow the instructions.

After npm is installed, you can now [install the VTEX IO CLI.](/en/tutorial/installing-vtex-io-cli)
