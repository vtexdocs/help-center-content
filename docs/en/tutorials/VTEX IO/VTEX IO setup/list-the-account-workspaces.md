To see the workspaces that currently exist in an account, simply use the following command:

`vtex workspace list`

Check out this example:

![workspace list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/VTEX IO/VTEX IO setup/list-the-account-workspaces_1.png)

The columns that will appear are as follows:

- __Name__: name of the workspace.
- __Last Modified__: date of last modification made to the workspace.
- __State__: whether the workspace is ready for development (`production false`) or for production (`production true`).

By default, every account is created with the __master__ and __draft__ workspaces.
