**Keywords:** Amazon, orders, integration

When an integration error occurs in orders between **Amazon** and a store, an error message is displayed for each affected order. To check if an order has integration errors, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Marketplace > Connections > Orders**, or type **Orders** in the search bar.

The most common errors in Amazon orders are:

- **SLA error**
- **SKU out of stock**
- **Inactive SKU**
- **SKU with no trade policy**
- **Unknown SKU**
- **Communication error with the catalog**
