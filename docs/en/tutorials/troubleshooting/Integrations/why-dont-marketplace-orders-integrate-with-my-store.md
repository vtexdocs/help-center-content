When order integration errors occur between a marketplace and your store, messages are displayed on the page of each order with the error. The possible order integration errors are the following:  

- Incomplete shipping information.  
- Amount divergence.  
- Invalid SKU ID.  
- Unavailable inventory.  
- Unavailable status.  
- Carrier not registered in the ERP.  

Check the status of order integration and messages by going to the VTEX Admin, and clicking **Marketplace > Connections > Orders** or typing **Orders** in the search bar.
