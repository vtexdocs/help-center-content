When [exporting a report with data from Master Data v1](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/exporting-data--tutorials_1125), the report is sent to the email address entered during the export. However, the email may take longer than expected to arrive in your inbox.

## Solution

You can access the report in Master Data by following the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data**.
2. Click **Exports**.
3. Make sure you are in the **Applications** tab.
4. In **Export Status**, identify the row of the report you want to access.
5. If the **Status** is **Completed - Download**, click `Download` to download the file.
