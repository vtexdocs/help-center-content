A __pricing rule__ is a set of conditions that determine the prices for a certain sales policy.

By default, the __base price__ registered for a product is applied to all sales policies. The pricing rule uses this price as a reference to apply its conditions.

To create a pricing rule specific to a sales policy, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Prices > Price rules**, or type **Price rules** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on `New rule`.
3. In the __Trade policy__ field, choose the desired trade policy.
4. Choose whether the rule will be applied to __all products__ of this policy or __only in categories and brands chosen__.
5. Choose if the rule will be applied to itens within a __markup range__.
6. Choose if the rule will be applied to a specific __period of time__.
7. Finally, choose what will be the price variation of this rule in relation to the base price of the products. Notice that a negative value indicates a discount should be applied.
8. Click on `Save`.

You now have a pricing rule configured for a sales policy.
