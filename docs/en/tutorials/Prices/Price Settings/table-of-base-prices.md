- **SKU ID**: The SKU ID is the number that a specific SKU is identified by. Have a look at our article to find out how you can [find a SKU ID](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/where-to-find-the-SKU-ID--4VQZsYeb3igGK2YowuEYWW)

- **Cost Price**: Your SKU's production cost. If no such information is available, you can fill this field out with the same value as that of the **Base Price**.

- **Base Price**: A product's reference sales price.

- **List Price**: The list price functions as a SKU's former price assumed to be on sale. It's also known as the "original price" and can be shown in your store's window display. This field is optional when registering a price. 

>ℹ️ In **Cost Price**, **Base Price** and **List Price**, you can insert decimal values separated by dot. Example: `4.95`.

The next spreadsheet fields are optional, used only to make SKU identification easier. To view these fields in the spreadsheet, you'll need to select the *include metadata in exported tables* export option.
