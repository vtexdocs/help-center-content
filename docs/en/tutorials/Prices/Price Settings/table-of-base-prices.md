For a better understanding of how to fill the [table of base prices](/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/P99EjtrlRHk92Q8qDPq29#spreadsheet), read the full description of each field below.

- **SKU ID**: The SKU ID is the number that a specific SKU is identified by. Have a look at our article to find out how you can [find a SKU ID](/en/tutorial/where-to-find-the-SKU-ID--4VQZsYeb3igGK2YowuEYWW)

- **Cost Price**: Your SKU's production cost. If no such information is available, you can fill this field out with the same value as that of the **Base Price**.

- **Base Price**: A product's reference sales price.

- **List Price**: The list price functions as a SKU's former price assumed to be on sale. It's also known as the "original price" and can be shown in your store's window display. This field is optional when registering a price.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
When filling out the spreadsheet for the <b>Cost Price</b>, <b>Base Price</b> and <b>List Price</b> fields, the characters must be the <code>General</code> type. Using other formats will result in errors when importing the spreadsheet.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>In <b>Cost Price</b>, <b>Base Price</b> and <b>List Price</b>, you can insert decimal values separated by dot. Example: <code>4.95</code>.</p>
</div>

The next spreadsheet fields are optional, used only to make SKU identification easier. To view these fields in the spreadsheet, you'll need to select the *include metadata in exported tables* export option.
