Price configurations are accessed by the **Settings** button in the **Prices** module.

On this screen you can register a minimum markup. Below we explain what a markup is and how to configure it.

## Markup

Markup is a margin which is added to the cost price of a product or service to define its selling price. In other words, it is the profit margin.

### Average markup

An average markup is used only when prices are externally integrated, and there is no cost price. When this happens, the system uses the base price and the average markup to estimate a cost price.

### Minimum markup

Minimum markup is entered on the Configurações screen as a benchmark for two scenarios:

- **Definition of markup on the base price**: When a markup is created for the base price, its value is compared to the minimum markup – if it is lower, registration is impossible.
- **Highlight in the price list**: If a rule with a negative percentage is created which affects the profit on an SKU, reducing it to below the minimum profit (markup), the markup amount will be highlighted in red.

The initial minimum markup, for each commercial policy, is always zero, and can be freely adjusted to positive or negative values.
