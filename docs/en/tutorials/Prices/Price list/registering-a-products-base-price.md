- In the SKU you want, click on the box with the title __Base price__. A sidebar will open.
- In the __Cost price__ field, fill in the cost of the SKU.
- In the __Markup__ field, fill in the profit margin to be obtained by selling this SKU.
- The base price will be calculated according to the data provided in the previous steps.
