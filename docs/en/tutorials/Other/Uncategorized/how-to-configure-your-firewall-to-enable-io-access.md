A few corporate firewalls require slight adjustments to be made in order to access the VTEX IO platform

In most cases you will only need to enable HTTP and HTTPS access to the  `*.myvtex.com` and `*.vtex.io` domains

In case you are still unable to access the platform, you will need to grant access to the following aditional URLs:

cdn.polyfill.io
io.vtex.com.br 
unpkg.com (contains React, vtex-tachyons, animate and etc)
*.vteximg.com.br (contains additional javascripts and other VTEX.IO assets)
