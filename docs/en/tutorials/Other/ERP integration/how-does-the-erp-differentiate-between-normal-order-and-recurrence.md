The difference is in the json for integration of the order with the ERP.

In a recurrence, the parameter **“itemAttachment”** will give the frequency (e.g.: **“período”: “Semanal”**) and the parameter **“attachments”** will give the type of attachment **“Recorrência”**.

In a recurring order created automatically, the above parameters are not entered, since they are included in the service agreement. But the **“openTextField”** tag will show the value = **“Order Created By VTEX Recurrence System”**.

This is the data that differentiates a normal order from a recurrence.
