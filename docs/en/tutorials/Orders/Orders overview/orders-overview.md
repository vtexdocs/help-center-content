Each purchase on your VTEX store generates at least one order. During the post-purchase process, the platform offers resources that allow you to manage several aspects of the orders, such as products, transactions, shipping, and subscription information. You can find these features in the **Orders** menu.

See below for the different sections and pages in this menu.

## Orders

In the **Orders** section, you can view all information regarding the status of the orders placed in your store. You can also send invoices and modify products, among other actions.

This section includes the following pages:

- [All Orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/all-orders--6JHeydzIft46VY7JTEpbJT)  
- [Order Details](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-do-pedido--2Y75n54Cc9VizrlG1N6ZNl)   
- [Transactions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-view-transactions-on-pci-gateway--tutorials_461) 
- [Bank reconciliation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/bank-reconciliations--tutorials_453) 

Besides searching for orders in **Orders > All Orders**, you can search for orders from any page in the VTEX Admin using the global search bar at the top bar. By default, the search is configured as `Pages`. To search for an order, click on the bar, select `Orders`, and use one of the following criteria:

- Order ID
- Customer name
- Customer email
- Customer document

>ℹ️ You can only access information from orders created in the last two years, and that same period is valid for customers through [My Account](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-my-account-works--2BQ3GiqhqGJTXsWVuio3Xh).

## Subscriptions

On the VTEX platform, you can create [subscriptions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-subscriptions-work--frequentlyAskedQuestions_4453), which means that you can offer your customers the possibility to automatically place recurring orders at a set frequency.

To manage this feature in your store, this section includes the following pages:  
- [Dashboards](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-manage-subscriptions--6Jk50FPbv6iuz1OsFypv8x)  
- [Subscription plans](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/subscription-plans-beta--5kczKRqHEsrs1tYtRcY8wR)
