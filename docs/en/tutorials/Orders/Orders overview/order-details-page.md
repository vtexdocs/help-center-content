The order details page allows you to view all the information of an order and manage it in a single place. To access it, in the VTEX Admin, go to **Orders > [All orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/lista-de-pedidos-beta--2QTduKHAJMFIZ3BAsi6Pi)**, and click the desired order.

You can also search for orders from any page in the VTEX Admin using the global search bar at the top bar. By default, the search is configured as `Pages`. To search for an order, click on the bar, select `Orders`, and use one of the following criteria:

- Order ID
- Customer name
- Customer email
- Customer document

On the order details page, you can:

* Check in which stage of the order flow the order is (order status).
* View the entire change history of the order.
* View the payment method used.
* Check the promotions applied to the order (if any).
* Send and track emails sent to the customer.
* Send the order invoice.
* Change items in the order.
* Manage package returns.
* Cancel the order.

The order details page is divided into blocks that group information or features together. See below the sections of the page and their respective functions.

To learn more about the order flow and when to handle an order, read the article [Order flow and status](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/fluxo-e-status-de-pedidos--tutorials_196).

### Items to invoice

![Itens faturarEN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2wScKr5ZaHShpyntCuN0jy/c88e7dc843b651ed6b703ed4cd05ba3c/Itens_faturarEN.png)

The block **Items to Invoice** contains packages with items for which payment has been approved but not yet [invoiced](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/pedidos--2xkTisx4SXOWXQel8Jg8sa/2WgQrlHTyVo4hLjhUs1LMT), i.e. their invoices have not been uploaded to the platform.

The package is the wrapping or box that contains the items of a delivery. Please note that a single order may include more than one package if it consists of items from different sellers or different warehouses. For more information about package split, check out the article [Order split and delivery split](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/divisao-de-pedidos-e-divisao-de-entregas--jQvzA6QgSd51e2p6bthoV).

* **Change:** you can change the items in an order. Please note that [changing items](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-alterar-itens-do-pedido--7jekq618QxgbsOxKkXBjE8) is different from [replacing orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/substituicao-de-pedidos--2IK9mwQjBKseQmE8K8saO8). When replacing an order, the customer requests changes to the order, and when changing items, the store modifies the order.
* **Invoice:** you can generate the order invoice. Learn more about sending invoices in the article [How invoice an order](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-faturar-um-pedido-manualmente--7p1h852V5t54KyscpgxE2v).
