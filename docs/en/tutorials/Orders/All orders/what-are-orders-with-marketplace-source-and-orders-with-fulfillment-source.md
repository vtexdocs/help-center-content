By accessing the section __All orders__, in __Orders management__, it is possible to view and track the orders made in your store through the [orders list](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/list-of-orders/). 

The column __Origin__ indicates where the order came from, distinguishing each other in two possible origins: __Marketplace__ and __Fulfillment__.

## Marketplace

For VTEX, a store is a marketplace when the order is directly placed on it - that is, when it receives the payment and therefore starts the order cycle.

Therefore, the order origin is indicated as __Marketplace__ when an order was made directly to your store. That is, when your store received and processed the payment.

Two scenarios are possible:

- Your store, in addition to having received the payment, will make the delivery. That is, it acts as a marketplace (because it received the payment) and also as a seller (because it is responsible for the whole order cycle, from payment processing to delivery).
- Your store only receives payment - delivery is made by a seller integrated to your store.

In either case, the origin of the order appears as __Marketplace__.

### Fulfillment

For VTEX, a store is a seller when it must comply with the obligation to deliver the product to the customer

Therefore, the order origin is indicated as __Fulfillment__ when your store is acting as a seller, that is, when the payment was processed by another store (the marketplace), and your store is only responsible for the delivery of the products.
