Orders from a marketplace follow almost the same structure as store orders, but there are some details that vary.

In the VTEX Admin, go to **Orders > All Orders**, or type **All Orders** in the search bar at the top of the page. In that page, there are all of your store's orders, and we will what are a marketplace order's characteristics.

## All Orders page

In the [All Orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/todos-os-pedidos--2QTduKHAJMFIZ3BAsi6Pi) page, the column **Order ID** shows the order identification code. Orders made in marketplaces have a sufix `-01`, for example.

On the column **Origin**, it is also written `Marketplace` when the order was made in one.

## Order details page

In the [order details page](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-do-pedido--2Y75n54Cc9VizrlG1N6ZNl), in the **Payment** section, it is possible to view the name of the merchant associated with the order.
