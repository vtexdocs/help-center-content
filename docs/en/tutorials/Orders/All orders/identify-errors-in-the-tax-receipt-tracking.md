In order to make sure the tax receipt tracking works properly, analyze the following items, which are the primary causes for malfunctioning:

- Check whether the tracking number is incorrect
- Check whether the tracking URL is incorrect
- Check whether the transport company is incorrect
- Access the tracking URL by entering the number on the browser and check whether you are accessing the tracking monitoring page
- Check whether the transport company is on the [list of companies registered for tracking](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/which-transport-companies-enable-make-it-possible-to-track-delivery "list of companies registered for tracking").

_Adjust these items and follow up the triggering of the e-mails using the time line in the order._
