The VTEX platform offers an easy way to follow up on the development of the number of orders closed at your store. 

The following data set is displayed on the __All orders__ screen in the __Orders Management__ section, and it contains information that is useful for monitoring orders:

- Orders sent __today__ until the current time;
- Orders sent __yesterday__ until the same time;
- Orders sent on the same day __last week__, until the same time;
- Orders sent on the same day __last year__,  until the same time;

Alongside each of these values, a percentage representing the variation against today's orders will appear.

In the screenshot of the metrics above, the following information will be displayed:

- Today, the store received 2464 orders until 8:50 p.m.;
- Yesterday, the store received 2176 orders until the same time;
- On the same day last week, the store received 1856 orders until 8:50 p.m.;
- Finally, compared to one year ago, there was a significant increase in the number of orders: on the same day last year, until the same time, the store received 1425 orders, against 2464 this year.

>ℹ️ The calculation of orders placed in the **last year** is done by subtracting 52 weeks from the current day. This keeps the reference to same the day of the week. For example: November 24/2017 will be compared with November 25/2016, where both dates are on a Friday.

The ranking containing these data is placed on the right corner of the bar, and it shows the position of the store among all VTEX stores. The metrics on its side indicates the evolution between yesterday and today. 

The bar does not show the precise position of the top 5 stores of the ranking: for these, the number shown will be always “Top 5”.

For all data regarding changes in orders, and also regarding ranking evolution figures, the green color means a “positive” result; blue means “neutral”; and red means “negative”.

_Important: if the comparison of orders is based on 0 orders in the past, the variation will be 0%._
