In [order details page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/pagina-de-detalhes-do-pedido--2Y75n54Cc9VizrlG1N6ZNl), the **Order History** section includes order details such as the order workflow, payment method used, emails exchanged with the customer and the possibility of including comments.

Its main purpose is to illustrate the entire flow that occurred with the order, so as to easily identify deviations from standard behavior or to easily identify order information.

The **Order History** section consists of several parts described below.

## Status transition

The evolution of the order workflow, that is, the different statuses, is accompanied at the same time by the time line. Moreover, it presents, in the best manner, the origin and the transitions for each status, in relation to the events that occur throughout the order period, such as payment, for example.

## Payment method used

One of the first items of information to appear on the time line will be the payment method used. Here it will be possible to interact to validate information such as the affiliate used, the payment ID and automatic settlement of information â€“ as the case may be among others.

## Emails exchanged with the customer

The **Order History** section relates directly with the [conversarion tracker](/en/tutorial/understanding-the-conversation-tracker "conversarion tracker"), which is used to unify all communication with a customer during the flow of an order. In addition, all communication by other systems with the email used in the order will be documented on the time line.

That is, all interactions such as payment approved, preparing delivery, billing, shipment and delivery will be notified to the customer by email. These emails will be registered on the time line of the order.

## Comments

At the end of the **Order History**, there will be a space for the storeowner to define or inform some detail for those who will handle the order while it is being processed. These comments are not sent to the customer associated with the order in question. This will be used for in-house engagements, through some intervention or change in the manner of delivery.
