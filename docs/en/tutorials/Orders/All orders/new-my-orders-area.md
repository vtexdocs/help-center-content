>⚠️ This update is a *major* and **not compatible with the customizations of the current My Orders section**.

> Because the new page structure is completely different, it will be necessary to remake the customizations to migrate to this version. See details on how to update your customization in [Customizando a Seção Meus Pedidos](http://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/customizando-a-secao-meus-pedidos).

VTEX is always looking to use a modern stack to create products that deliver more value to the ecosystem. For this reason, we started using the React JS library in our most recent systems and features: the new **My Orders** feature is one example. The newest version comes with new features and design, and was created from scratch using React.

### New navigation experience

React wasn't chosen only so this release was aligned with the remaining of the VTEX platform — because it's a single-page application loaded within the store, the new orders area has a fluid navigation, improving the user experience.

### Features

This update in the My Orders will be the starting point for new features, but this one already brings improvements, like a mobile-ready layout and order timeline — a feature lots of agencies implemented on their own.

Another new feature are the pre-defined cancelling reasions that the client can choose when cancelling an order. These reasons can be easily customized and translated in Portal v2:

For the first time, we're also supporting native translation of the My Orders to french, right from the interface!

### How to activate

To avoid compatibility issues and reduce the chance of breaking customizations, the new My Orders comes with an opt-in, that allows stores to migrate on the speed they wish. This opt-in checkbox is in the Portal v2, in the same section as the cancelling reasons:

Before activating the new version, you can see it accessing your store through the beta environment: `accountname.vtexcommercestable.com.br/account/orders`.

This opt-in will be available until **July 24 2017**. After this, all stores will be migrated to the new version in stable, and the old one will be discontinued.

It's important to note customizations must be re-done, as the new structure of the page is completely different. To see more details about how to update your customization, see the [tutorial about customizing the My Orders](http://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/customizando-a-secao-meus-pedidos).
