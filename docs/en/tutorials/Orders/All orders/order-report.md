When you export an order report on the [All Orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/todos-os-pedidos--2QTduKHAJMFIZ3BAsi6Pi) page, the system generates a report in `.csv` format containing details about the orders placed in your store.

Each row in the spreadsheet refers to a [SKU](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-um-sku--1K75s4RXAQyOuGUYKMM68u). For example, if an order contains 3 SKUs, it will be listed in 3 rows of the report, each dedicated to data of one SKU.
