VTEX DO manages tasks generated by the platform modules to be carried out by the store’s e-commerce team. It is currently accessible using the Orders Management module and the Payments.

To view the list of tasks, just click on the lower right-hand corner of the Orders Management screen.  Some examples of these tasks are: __review payment for cancelation; reverse payment out; approve order under authority limit; cancellation requested and many others,__ since each module existing on VTEX has the autonomy and permission to post any information.

This functionality allows users the following actions: allocating tasks to someone (even to themselves), marking them as completed, adding a comment and seeing more details, which redirects them to where the task needs to be done. “adiar” and “ignorar” buttons exist, but they are future actions still under development.

## Assign and unassign a task to yourself

### Assign a task
Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the empty star in the list of tasks or within a given task.

### Unassign a task
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Access the **MINHAS** tab;
- Click on the filled in star on the list of tasks or within the task itself.

## Assign and unassign a task to other user

### Assign a task
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the “Ações” button of the task you wish to assign, whether on the list or within the task itself;
- Write the name or e-mail of the user who has to complete the task;
- Click on the suggestion that appears below, with the user’s name.

### Unassign a task
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the “Ações” button of the task, whether on the list or within the task itself;
- Click on the option **Ninguém** immediately below the search field that opens.

_The tasks assigned to you appear in the tab entitled “MINHAS”. Another detail is that if the star is filled in, it means that the task has been assigned to someone, otherwise it has not._

## Filter a task

Filtering is possible through the search bar by using the name of the task and the name of the user attributed to them or by entering observations. It also permits filtering according to the module that posted the task.

### Through the search bar
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the search bar;
- Enter the name of the task, a user name or the observation used.

### Through modules that posted the task
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the search button;
- Select the desired module.

## Perform the task

Since the purpose of the functionality is to perform the tasks, one facility it provides is that of redirecting to the module that posted the task within the order, transaction or any other specific address of the respective module that created the task.

1. Open VTEX DO;
2. Click on the task you wish to perform;
3. Check the description of what needs to be done;
4. Click on the **ver mais detalhes** button;
5. Perform the task as described.

## Conclude or reopen a task

In order to maintain VTEX DO organized, the ideal is to conclude the task after performing it, so as to avoid reworking or wasting time in the future when revisiting the list of tasks. Another possibility would be to conclude a task even without performing it, for example, if cancellation of an order is requested, but you managed to turn the situation around. Should you need to reopen a task that was improperly concluded, don’t worry, because you can reopen it at any time. Just search for it on the list and follow the steps of the following gif.

### Conclude a task
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the task you wish to conclude;
- Click on the **Fechar** button.

### Reopen a task
- Open **VTEX DO**;
- Click on the task you wish to reopen;
- Click on the **Reabrir tarefa** button.

## Insert a comment

Also with a view to organizing these tasks and using them to formalize communication, there is a function for entering comments, as needed, on a case-by-case basis.

1. Open **VTEX DO**;
2. Click on the task on which you wish to comment;
3. Click on the **Seu comentário** text field;
4. Type in what you want and click on the **Comentar** button.

Since it is possible to execute VTEX DO actions with it open, to close it you have to click on the down arrow, as shown in the gif below:
