The order flow can be displayed through diagrams or interactions. The first view is recommended when you need a view of the process as a whole, and the second when you want to find some specific error or detail.

To view the order's interactions, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Orders > All Orders**, or type **All Orders** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click the desired order.
3. Click `View Interactions`.

You will see the interactions of the **Orders** system with other systems required for an order to be successfully completed, such as **Logistics**, **Promotions & Taxes**, **Checkout**, **Payments** and external systems (ERPs, through integration).

The interactions show a detailed order log, with all interactions made since the order is accepted until it's invoiced. They are displayed in chronological order (from the bottom up) and indicate, for example, which user approved, canceled or billed a particular order.

In this way, it's easier to visualize the communication between systems and understand the status and possible errors in the flow of an order.
