When a customer purchases a product they have the option to make that order recurring, ie, to turn it into a subscription, so that the same products are automatically delivered to their address for a certain period.

Subscriptions are a great opportunity for the store to increase its revenue and gain customer loyalty.

The authentication requirement even for automatically authorized payment is a way for the store to validate the subscription and avoid possible trotting since with the flag activated the customer is requested to login for validation at the time of purchase.

To configure this authentication, follow the steps below.

1. Access **Orders Management**
2. Acces **Settings**
3. Activate the flag __Require user authentication for automatically authorized payments__.

4. Click on the __Save__ button.
