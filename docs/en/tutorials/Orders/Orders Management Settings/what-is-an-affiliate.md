>ℹ️ Affiliates in VTEX are different from the [usual definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing). Read below to learn more.

[Configuring an affiliate](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-configurar-afiliado) will only be necessary when the store acts as a seller in a marketplace.

An affiliate functions differently from [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-trade-policies-work--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV), since every marketplace must correspond to a unique affiliate code for the seller. In other words, the seller creates an affiliate code to identify each marketplace. Even if the same trade policy in being used, the affiliates must be different. If the integration is with a [native connector](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), the [affiliate](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-configurar-afiliado/) will be created automatically.

Besides identifying new orders, affiliates also act as webhooks that will notify the external service about changes on SKU's informations, inventory or pricing.
