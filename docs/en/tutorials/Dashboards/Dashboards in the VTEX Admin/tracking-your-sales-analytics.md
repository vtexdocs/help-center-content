__Insights__ is a dashboard in which you can track the evolution of your sales with a detailed view of the conversion funnel and the key metrics that impact your store's revenue. This tool is available in the VTEX Admin in *Analytics > Insights*.

The table below describes the key metrics available in Insights. All metrics refer to purchase flows made in VTEX stores in a given time frame.

| Metric         | Description     |
| ----------     | ---------- |
| Sessions       | Number of visits to store |
| Orders         | Number of orders placed |
| Conversion     | Percentage of sessions that turned into orders |
| Revenue        | Total amount determined by approved applications |
| Average Ticket | Average revenue per order |

>⚠️ We do not have access to session and conversion data concerning purchase flows made outside of VTEX stores. Therefore, orders placed in marketplaces are not included in Insights metrics.

## Getting to know the interface

The Insights interface displays the sales metrics of your store in three dashboards: [Overview](#overview), [Details](#details) and [Conversion Funnel](#conversion-funnel). Each dashboard features a comparison between the present day (*Today*) and a previous one (*Yesterday*, *7 days ago*, *4 weeks ago* or *12 weeks ago*).

### Overview

This dashboard allows you to compare the value of the consolidated metrics between the selected dates. Each column shows the accumulated value between midnight and the reference time for the data. To facilitate comparison, we also include the percentage variation between the dates.

### Details

This dashboard allows you to trace the evolution of the metrics throughout the day. By dragging the mouse over the charts, the value of the metrics is displayed at a specific time. It is also possible to filter the data regarding Desktop or Mobile devices in the selector in the top right corner of the dashboard.

### Conversion Funnel

This dashboard allows you to trace the volume of sessions in the intermediate stages of the purchase flow and spot opportunities to optimize the store's conversion rate. The table below describes the intermediate stages of the purchase flow.

| Intermediate stage | Description |
| ----------         | ---------- |
| Product stage      | A product page was accessed by the user during the session |
| Shopping cart stage     | A product was added to the cart by the user during the session |
| Shipping stage     | Shipping information was filled in by the user during the session |
| Payment stage      | Payment data was filled in during the session |

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
   <td>
    <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4DdN3hdCz7CdoukLu3H0Ea/bfac11a598fd989f1b0370d12566dbb3/Insights_-_Funil_de_conversa__o__2_.png?h=250" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Insights - Funil de conversão" title="Insights - Funil de conversão">

   <td style="text-align: center;">
     <em>
       Volume of sessions at each stage of the purchase flow
     </em>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each blue bar in the chart represents the volume of sessions that have reached a certain stage of the purchase flow. This session volume is represented as a percentage of the number of sessions (above) and as an absolute value (below). The percentage of visits that did not pass from one stage to the next is presented among each stages' absolute value. To change among the selected days, use the selector in the upper right corner.
