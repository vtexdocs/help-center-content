The *Dashboards* menu is a control panel that displays data for your unified commerce. The analyses presented here can inform decisions and help prioritize tasks for different professionals, from operations to commercial and marketing. The Dashboards include up-to-date data from all sales channels in which your store operates with VTEX, including key metrics that impact your store revenue.

This information can be found in the **Dashboards** menu of your Admin. 

This section includes the following pages, which are already available in your Admin :

- [Overview](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/store-overview--6mcM4LPUqQxSiXY6uFtXZy): where store owners have access to key metrics that impact their store revenue. In this dashboard, you can track the evolution of your sales through order trend analysis, conversion rate, and sales funnel charts.  
- [Sales Performance](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/sales-performance--6gx46RGRzWO8qgaVck7PRp): a dashboard for unified commerce that helps stores grow their business and make more accurate decisions.
