VTEX Admin’s Overview page is where store owners can get a quick overview of key metrics that impact the store’s revenue. Through this dashboard, you can track the evolution of your sales through order trend analysis, conversion rate and sales funnel charts. You can access this tool in the VTEX Admin, by clicking on **Dashboards > Overview** in the navigation menu, or type *Overview* in the search bar at the top of the page.

![Store Overview gif EN](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4vKmiLmTVUtaxn5vzpX5xq/27b257963a3bcd2e24374c78e8bcbc4a/Store_Overview_gif_EN.gif)

 The Overview page provides a summary of your business with VTEX. For deeper analysis of your store's metrics, visit [Sales Performance](https://help.vtex.com/en/v4/docs/performance-de-vendas--6gx46RGRzWO8qgaVck7PRp).

## Data

The metrics on this page include data about orders and browsing, which are captured from different systems.

* **Orders:** the order and revenue data come from the VTEX Order Management System (OMS) and include orders placed on all of your sales channels. 
* **Browsing:** the browsing data comes from the platform’s internal system which captures user sessions on the storefront of VTEX stores. A session represents the total number of views on pages accessed by a single buyer while browsing your store, without considering marketplaces, apps, VTEX Sales App, or other sales channel. 

We do not capture browsing data for storefronts other than VTEX or for sellers who only offer products on external marketplaces. For this reason, the charts displayed on your Overview may vary, depending on whether we capture browsing data from your store or not.  

In the table below, you can find a summary of the charts included for each scenario of store data capture. 

| Store data capture     | Included charts                                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complete browsing data | Order trend analysis<br>Conversion rate<br>Sales funnel<br>Sessions |
| Partial browsing data  | Received orders<br>Canceled orders<br>Sales funnel<br>Sessions      |
| No browsing data       | Placed orders<br>Canceled orders<br>Highest grossing categories     |

Though we try to keep a maximum of 3% divergence from the VTEX OMS data, you may sometimes find discrepancies between the data presented in Overview and the one in OMS. To have the page updated on a daily basis and functioning swiftly, the data is stored in different groups, separated in “online” or short-term data (such as the metrics that have just been filtered) and the long-term data (such as the data exported as a spreadsheet, which comprises more information). Each group is processed by a different system, which can cause the OMS data to differ from the one in Overview.

## Comparing periods

The page's data is updated every hour, so users can expect a delay of 10 to 80 minutes, depending on the time they accessed the page. Users can also filter data by period, and also compare their store’s current metrics with previous ones. The `Updated` label shows the last time the data was updated. 

To compare data from different periods, on the top of the page, select the date on the *first dropdown menu*, then select the second date on the *second dropdown menu*. The date filters include the following options: 

| Period       | Start                                               | End                                                                                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Today        | 12:00 a.m. of the current day                       | The last time data was updated. Check out the `Updated` label to see when was the last update. |
| Yesterday    | 12:00 a.m. of the previous day                      | 11:59 p.m. of the previous day                                                                 |
| Last 7 days  | 12:00 a.m. of the eighth day before the current day | 11:59 p.m. of the day before the current day                                                   |
| Last 28 days | 12:00 a.m. of the 29th day before the current day   | 11:59 p.m. of the day before the current day                                                   |

This chart shows your store’s order trend, indicating the number of orders placed by shoppers in the selected period.

The line indicates the order curve for the selected period. By hovering the mouse over the chart, the value of the metric for a specific day or hour span is displayed. The shades around the curve are confidence intervals indicating the expected order behavior on each date. The blue shade represents an interval with a 90% confidence, while the lighter shade has 99% confidence. Intervals are calculated according to the past 3 months, in which the chart’s algorithm considers the date and time to calculate the expectation.

The number shown on top of the chart refers to the orders placed in the last hour and it is updated every five minutes.  The label on top of the chart indicates whether orders are being placed at a `normal`, `low` or `high` rate when compared to your store’s usual performance for that period. 

## Conversion rate
![Store overview Conversion rate EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/1S5WA2yR00R1GuBU0NoKaZ/f6435fce96325abc0e8c4f11021234bf/Store_overview_Conversion_rate_EN.jpg)  

This chart shows your store’s conversion rate in the selected periods you wish to compare.

This volume is represented as an absolute value (above), and as a percentage of the number of sessions (below), together with the percentual points (p.p) of increase or decrease in the sales funnel. By hovering the mouse over the percentage, you can view more details about that intermediate stage.
