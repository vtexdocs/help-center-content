# Equipment, software and infrastructure
 
The operational systems versions compatible with VTEX inStore are __Android 6.0__ _(or newer)_, __iOS 9__ _(or above)_ and __Windows 8__ _(or above)_.
 
The inStore app, developed by VTEX, is integrated with the online store, using the same product catalogue. The prices and payment conditions, for that part, can be customized for each store. 
 
The app is automatically updated when a new version becomes available. In few cases, a manual update is necessary, but we always make it very clear what should be done.
 
Internet connection is fundamental to the functioning of VTEX inStore. The communication between the app, VTEX and partners is all done through internet. 
 
To issue a consumer's invoice, VTEX has integrations available with various ERPs and other systems responsible for that part of the process. You can better understand this functionality by consulting the [NFC-e Integration Guide](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/guide-to-integration-of-oms-with-electronic-tax-coupon-for-vtex-instore).
 
# Installing VTEX inStore in your store
 
## Team and technical support

You may need an infrastructure specialist, who will guarantee a stable internet connection for your store and access to all devices. A developer also can be needed to perform inStore's JavaScript setup.
 
## Installation

To install the inStore, you just need to download the latest version of the app on the device of your choice.
You can find the download links on [inStore's site](http://instore.vtex.com/#download) or directly on the Google Play and App Store, always searching for __VTEX inStore__.
 
## Settings
In order to use inStore is necessary to verify if some VTEX platform services are correctly configured.
 
For example, the barcode of the product must be registered in your catalogue for the machine to "beep" the product.
 
To know more information about settings, access the [inStore setup step-by-step](http://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-setup)
 
## Equipment

To maintain the equipment and the good working order of your operation, it's important to have more devices than sales reps. This way, the devices can be quickly swapped in case of failure, damage or battery depletion.
 
It's interesting to also allocate some safe space in your store to keep and charge the equipment.
 
### Tablets and smartphones

The minimum requirements for tablet and smartphones are related to the operational system. As previously mentioned, inStore works with __Android 6.0__ _(or above)_ e __iOS 9__ _(or above)_ devices.
 
Despite not being are requirement, we recommend that the devices used to access inStore have 4G chip for internet access. That way, your store will continue operating normally, even the Wi-Fi network has problems.
 
Some examples of devices that can be used: _Tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab A Note_, _Motorola G4_ e _Samsung S8_.
 
### Barcode reader

With inStore, you can read the barcode of your products using your tablet or smartphone camera, even though they may not work as well as devices specialized in that function. Therefore, we recommend that you use a dedicated reader if your store is used to receiving orders with many products (and it is important to have more agility and accuracy during checkout). 
You can choose any barcode reader to "beep" products in the inStore. One example that works very well is the Honeywell _Solaris MK7820_.

### Credit card machines

Credit card machines (Bluetooth or USB) are offered by payment partners (acquirers or sub-acquirers), who will process the payments in your brick-and-mortar store. See a list of them in the [__Partners__](http://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-instore#partners) section of this tutorial.

### Windows Computer

InStore also works in Windows, as long as the following minimum requirements are met:

- Windows 8 _(or newer)_
- Intel i3+ _(or newer)_ or AMD Phenom II X4 _(or newer)_
- 4GB of RAM _(or above)_
- 120GB of HD/SSD _(or above)_

### Therman printer

To print the Electronic Consumer Invoice (NFC-e) and card receipts, you will need a non-fiscal thermal printer.
Some of the recommended models are: _EPSON T20 USB_, _EPSON TM-M30_ or _ELGIN I9 USB_.

### Electronic Price Tags

Electronic price tags allow you to change prices for products that are on the band-wagon through the VTEX platform. This makes it much easier to keep e-commerce and brick-and-mortar store prices in sync, as well as have promotions and give discounts without the need to print traditional paper price tags.
In case you want to find out more, see our list of partners that provide the hardware and uncover more details in the [instore setup step-by-step](http://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-setup).

## Partners

VTEX has some partners to enable the operation of brick-and-mortar stores. Each partner has a specific function so that the entire sale process can work safely.

VTEX already has a standard agreement with these partners to facilitate product deployment, but it is up to you to negotiate better terms directly with them.
