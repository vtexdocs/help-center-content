The check-in route of the Checkout calls Logistics in its flow. What does this mean? This means that for the operation of a physical store to function with in-store pick-up, Logistics requires registration of the address of the physical store in the dock. There is a selection field in the dock that links it to a physical store.

[Check out here the tutorial about the dock registration and how to label a dock as the pick-up point](/en/tutorial/how-to-register-a-dock).

After registering your stores on MasterData ([see here how to do this](/en/tutorial/how-to-register-a-store-in-vtex-instore)), you can choose the store you would like to associate with this dock, as shown in the image below:

For each registered store, a corresponding dock should exist.
