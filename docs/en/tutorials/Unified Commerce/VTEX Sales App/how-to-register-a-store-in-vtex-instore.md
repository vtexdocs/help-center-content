### How to register a physical store

After the screen asking for the name of the environment, the app will ask for the identification of the salesperson. This serves to identify the sales made by the salesperson, and to identify the store to which the salesperson is connected. This will enable the correct application of prices, payment conditions and product availability.

To manage the registration of your physical stores, simply access your Masterdata.  After accessing the Masterdata, search for the area named "Profile System". In this area, search for the word ‚ÄúLojas‚Äù and click on ‚Äúlistar‚Äù as shown in the image below.

* If you are not able to find this application, it means that your environment has not been set up correctly. In this case, we recommend using the environment settings tutorial for use by inStore.*
