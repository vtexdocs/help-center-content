WhatsApp AI Campaigns is a feature developed by VTEX to recover abandoned checkouts.

When a user leaves the payment page, the platform identifies this action. If the user does not return to complete the order within 1 hour, the feature sends them a notification via WhatsApp.

The main advantages of this feature are:

- **Improved customer experience:** Messages can be personalized to increase relevance and strengthen the relationship with the brand.

- **Increased conversion rates and sales:** The feature encourages customers to return to the payment page to complete their purchase, thereby increasing sales and conversion rates for retailers.

>ℹ️ WhatsApp AI Campaigns is only available for stores using [Store Framework](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/store-development--3fHF3GIjK8UugnQKIakpl9/5DTcawNjc5MovtD7HNqURl#store-framework) that don't have Checkout customizations.
