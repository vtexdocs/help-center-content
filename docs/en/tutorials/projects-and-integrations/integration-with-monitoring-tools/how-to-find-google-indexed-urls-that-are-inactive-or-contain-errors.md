This article will help you complement your URL mapping. If your store did not sell a product, or if you are deploying a new VTEX store, you must direct all previous URLs to their corresponding URLs in the new environment, otherwise, the pages indexed by Google with the former content will be lost, and there will be a drop in the search and positioning of your website on the search engine. This process is intended to find URLs that are inactive or contain errors.

Access your Google Web Master Tools account. On this screen, you will already be able to check the numbers of pages that contain errors.

Click on **Tracking** and then on **Tracking Errors** as shown below:

In this area, you will be able to view when the error occurred, the corresponding URL, and the type of error. Now, you will be able to export a worksheet (\*.csv).

You will be able to include these links in the worksheet by referring to Home or collection, whichever is more appropriate to your store. After correcting these links, go back to the Web Master Tools and click on **Tracking** and then on **Tracking Errors**.
