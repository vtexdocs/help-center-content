Using structured data provides search mechanisms with an improved understanding of the contents of each page of your store.

There are several types of structured data. The most popular are: Schema, Open Graph and Microdata.

Data structuring should take place in the composition of your page template, by entering the tags directly in the code. This action, however, may require the effort of a development team. In order to facilitate this process, Google Search Console makes available the option “Marcador de Dados.”

Marcador de Dados is an identification and relationship interface that enables the structuring of data without requiring efforts of a development team.

Through simple phases, users are able to inform Google about the pages that must be identified as structured data.

Through Google Search Console **Marcador de Dados **you can structure data for the following purposes:

- Applications
- Articles
- Movies
- Local Businesses
- TV Episodes
- Events
- Products
- Book reviews
- Restaurants

With regard to e-commerce sites, only the **Local Businesses** and **Products** data types are important.

See below the marking process steps for e-commerce sites:

## Local Businesses

With this type of information, users are able to send to Google information about the company represented on the e-commerce site, with greater focus on companies that also have offline channels:

- Phone: ***mandatory**

Please note that the **Marcador de Dados** only identifies data for Google. For other search tools, you will have to structure data through tags inserted in the source code.
