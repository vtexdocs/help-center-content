The subscription report is a document in `CSV` format that contains information about subscriptions, such as their creation date, customer email, and active SKU.

You can generate the report using the [Generate 
report](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/subscriptions-api-v3?endpoint=post-/api/rns/pvt/reports/-reportName-/documents) endpoint.

The following types of reports are available:
- [Subscriptions with status](#subscriptions-with-status)
- [Subscriptions scheduled between dates](#subscriptions-scheduled-between-dates)
- [Subscriptions updated between dates](#subscriptions-updated-between-dates)
- [Subscriptions created between dates](#subscriptions-created-between-dates)
- [Subscriptions triggered between dates](#subscriptions-triggered-between-dates)

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>You can also use the endpoint <a href=https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/subscriptions-api-v3#get-/api/rns/pvt/reports>List report templates</a> to learn the types of reports you can generate.</p>
