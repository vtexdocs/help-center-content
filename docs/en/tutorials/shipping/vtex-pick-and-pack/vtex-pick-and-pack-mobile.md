The [VTEX Pick and Pack](/en/tutorial/vtex-pick-and-pack-fulfillment--1zGUEItEEVsal6cuBEBNcA) mobile app helps the picker — the person who picks and packs items in the facility — handle orders, from picking to shipping. This makes the store's order picking and delivery flow smoother and more efficient.

![pickpack-mobile-en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/shipping/vtex-pick-and-pack/vtex-pick-and-pack-mobile_1.png)

Order handling is divided into three steps, following the usual store order flow:

- [Create worksheets](#creating-worksheets)
- [Picking](#picking)
- [Packing](#packing)

## Menu

The __VTEX Pick and Pack__ app menu provides the main features to help you navigate and complete tasks. Through it, you can access different areas of the app more efficiently.

Tap the <i class="fas fa-grip-lines"></i> icon in the top-right corner to open the menu,  where you'll find the following fields:

- <i class="fas fa-house"></i> __Summary__:  Takes you to the app's home screen.
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/shipping/vtex-pick-and-pack/vtex-pick-and-pack-mobile_11.png" alt="pickpack-logout" width="30" height="30">: Logs out of the app.
- <i class="fas fa-history"></i> __History__: Redirects to the history of completed worksheets.
- <i class="fas fa-globe"></i> __Language__: Changes the app language.
- __Change to__ <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/shipping/vtex-pick-and-pack/vtex-pick-and-pack-mobile_12.png" alt="pickpack-logout" width="35" height="30">: Changes the facility where the order picking will be done.
- __Pending__: Redirects to the pending worksheets screen.
- __To pack__: Redirects to the worksheets that are awaiting packing.
- <i class="fas fa-bell"></i>: Notification area showing the latest changes to the worksheets.
- __Claim your next task__ <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>: Redirects to the screen for creating worksheets.

To collapse the menu, tap `Close Menu` <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>.

## Worksheets

A worksheet consists of a set of orders that will be processed by the Pick and Pack flow simultaneously. This allows for efficient management and speeds up the processing of multiple orders at once.

For example, a worksheet with only three orders:

- Order 1: A red t-shirt and a pink skirt.
- Order 2: Two red t-shirts and a white hat.
- Order 3: A pink skirt and a white hat.
When selecting this worksheet for handling, the app will display the following items for picking:

- Three red t-shirts.
- Two pink skirts.
- Two white hats.

The app will then help you pack each order with its respective items.

> ⚠️ Worksheets only apply to the order picking and packing steps. You must ship each order separately.

## Creating worksheets

The image of the tab below lists the orders that should be selected for [worksheets](#worksheets). 

![pickpack-ordemservico-en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/shipping/vtex-pick-and-pack/vtex-pick-and-pack-mobile_2.png)

The order list displays information as follows:

| Order     | Delivery by     |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Shows the order number along with the item quantity and total items.       | Order delivery due date.       |

### Pending worksheets

The __Pending worksheets__ tab displays the list of worksheets that haven't been picked yet, as shown in the image below:

![pickpack-pendente-en](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/tutorials/shipping/vtex-pick-and-pack/vtex-pick-and-pack-mobile_3.png)

2. Select __Pending__. A list will be displayed with the worksheets assigned to the picker in the picking step.
