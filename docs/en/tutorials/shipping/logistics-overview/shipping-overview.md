In an ecommerce, logistics is part of the customer experience as well as the store's business strategy. This means that the logistical configurations of your store are critical to your business. For this reason, the VTEX platform allows you to register and control your inventory, manage shipping and delivery rates, control item availability, and track deliveries. All these operations are performed in the **Shipping** menu of your Admin.

The Shipping menu has only one section, which is also labeled **Shipping**. Below you will find more details about the pages in the **Shipping** section of your Admin.

## Shipping rates

Shipping rates are the shipping costs that your store offers to customers. In this section, you can manage your store's shipping rates.

To learn more, please refer to the following articles:

- [Shipping rates](/en/tutorial/shipping-rates--1Balpg3rv0854udEPedvMM): explains how shipping rates are calculated and how to create them.
- [Managing shipping rates](/en/tutorial/managing-shipping-rates--tutorials_141): explains how to manage a specific shipping rate using zip code.
- [Shipping rate template](/en/tutorial/shipping-rate-template--tutorials_127): explains how to create shipping rates in bulk (instead of creating them individually).

## Shipping simulator

The shipping simulator is a tool used to validate[ shipping rates](/en/tutorial/shipping-rates--1Balpg3rv0854udEPedvMM). The simulation verifies the shipping conditions, allowing the retailer to check item availability, delivery methods, costs, and delivery times.

With the information provided in the simulation, the retailer can assess the reasons why some carriers were disregarded for delivery in a certain location.

Check out the article about the[ Shipping simulator](/en/tutorial/shipping-simulation--tutorials_144) to understand how it works and to see how the details of the simulation are presented.

## Pickup points

Pickup points are places where customers can collect orders made on ecommerce platforms.

In this section, you can register new pickup points and view existing ones.

To understand how this type of delivery works, please refer to the article[ How pickup points work](/en/tutorial/how-pickup-points-work--2fljn6wLjn8M4lJHA6HP3R). To learn more about pickup points, read our article[ Configuring Pickup points](/en/tutorial/adding-pickup-points--2R5ClQiwe4KoSQgsuiOw4E).

## Shipping strategy

[Shipping strategy](/en/tutorial/shipping-strategy--58vLBDbjYVQzJ6rRc5QNz3) is the relationship a store has with the warehouse, loading docks, and shipping policies. On the VTEX platform, the warehouse is the place where items are stored, the loading docks are the intermediaries between the warehouse and the carriers, and the shipping policies are the delivery rules agreed upon between the carrier and the store.

This section includes the storage and transport settings, and explains how they are connected.

The way the warehouse, loading docks, and shipping policy communicate will define the combination of the structure for delivering your customers' orders.

To understand how each part of the shipping strategy works, please refer to the articles below.
