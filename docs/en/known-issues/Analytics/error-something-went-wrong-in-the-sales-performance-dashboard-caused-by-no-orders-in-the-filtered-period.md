## Summary


In some cases, the error 'something went wrong' may appear on the sales performance dashboard. One of the scenarios that could lead to this error is if there are no orders within the selected time period, which impedes the data comparison and triggers the error message.


##

## Simulation


Access the sales performance dashboard and search for data in a period when there are no orders.


##

## Workaround


There are two workarounds available. One would be to change the filter to a period where orders exist, and the other would be to use the new dashboard UI, which is currently a beta version of the feature.
