## Summary


Sometimes, when the seller agent checks the order status right after placing the order, the "Processing" status can be found, even if the sale was initially successful on the checkout.

This is only a sync issue on the "last orders" page. The order is successfully placed, and the transaction is processed.


##

## Simulation


1- Place an order
2- Close the order placed page and quickly go to the last orders page.
3- Check the different statuses from the order placed page.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround available.
