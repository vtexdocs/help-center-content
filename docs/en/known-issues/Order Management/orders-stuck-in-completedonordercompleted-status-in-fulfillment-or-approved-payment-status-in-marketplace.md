## Summary


There are scenarios where some orders may get stuck in the "Completed" status in the Marketplace and when interacting with the order we get error information.
Just as it is possible to have orders stuck in "Approved Payment" in the Marketplace and in fulfillment it has the status "completed/on-order-completed".


##

## Simulation


It is not possible, at the moment, to simulate this scenario.


##

## Workaround


In this case, we were able to correct it manually, but it was necessary to open a ticket with the PS Order Management team.
In cases where the reservation has expired (status=4), manual adjustment is not possible!
