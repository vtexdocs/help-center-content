## Summary


There are scenarios where some orders may get stuck in the "start-handling" status in the Marketplace and when interacting with the order we receive error information.


##

## Simulation


It is not possible, at the moment, to simulate this scenario.


##

## Workaround


In this case, we were able to correct it manually, but it was necessary to open a ticket with the PS Order Management team.
In cases where the reservation has expired (status=4), manual adjustment is not possible!
