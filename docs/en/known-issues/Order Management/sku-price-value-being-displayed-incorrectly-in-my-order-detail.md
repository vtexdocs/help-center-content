## Summary


The list of items in the My Orders detail area is generated by merging the information returned by two internal routes. Although these routes provide similar data, they are not identical. When there are two SKUs of the same item in the order, the merge process can assign the same price to both, resulting in an incorrect display of the total value in the interface, diverging from the actual value recorded in the order.


##

## Simulation


Create an order with two different SKUs of the same item, but with different prices.
Access the order details area in My Orders.
Compare the prices displayed with the actual values in the order.
If the problem occurs, both SKUs will appear with the same price, causing the total shown to differ.


##

## Workaround


There is no workaround available.
