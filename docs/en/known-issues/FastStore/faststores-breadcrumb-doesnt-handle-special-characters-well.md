## Summary


If your store has categories with special characters, such as `/`, Fastestore's breadcrumb will not be able to handle it correctly.


##

## Simulation


Add a category with a special character such as `computers/softwares`
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/FastStore/faststores-breadcrumb-doesnt-handle-special-characters-well_1.png)

Go to the product's PDP and see how the breadcrumb is behaving:

Also, the link to the category will not work


##

## Workaround


N/A The suggestion is to avoid using those special characters on the categories' names
