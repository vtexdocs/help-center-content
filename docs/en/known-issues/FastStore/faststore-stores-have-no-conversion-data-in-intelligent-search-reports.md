## Summary


The conversion data of the Analytics module of the Intelligent Search is not being updated on stores using Faststore. This issue can affect all versions of Faststore, especially v1.

Currently, we have data on search terms and clicks but no valid conversion data. Several factors could be contributing to this problem. The team will investigate further and work on a solution to address it.


##

## Simulation


You can try buying products in a Faststore store, but the conversion data will not be updated or will not be a valid data.
