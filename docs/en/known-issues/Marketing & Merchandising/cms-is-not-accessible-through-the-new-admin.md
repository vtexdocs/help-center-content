## Summary

When accessing the CMS through the new administrative environment (My VTEX - `{AccountName}.myvtex.com/admin`), an error page is displayed, and the CMS can not be accessed.

![4JSc1cw](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/2SQ58O96w0u668aoMgeygI/2fe3498d2cade6d204c2b2b67e0be9b0/4JSc1cw.png)

## Simulation

- Access any store through the new administrative environment.
- Click the __CMS__ option in the side menu.

## Workaround

We're already taking care of this scenario, but in the meantime you need to access the catalog (which uses the old administrative environment - `vtexcommercestable`), and go from there to the CMS.
