## Summary


After changing the store's organization, the search filter failed to apply properly.

For example, when searching for a specific name, the expected results (such as no matches or a filtered set) are not displayed correctly. Instead, the system returns an incorrect number of results or fails to filter by the selected organization, showing irrelevant or unfiltered data.


##

## Simulation



1. Log into the store using valid user credentials.
2. Click on Change Organization.
3. Go to the search bar.
4. Enter a search term (e.g., "XYZ" or any other name you know exists).
5. It won't filter the term typed
