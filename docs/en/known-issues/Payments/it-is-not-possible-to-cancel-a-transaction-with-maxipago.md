## Summary


When the transaction has not progressed to the authorized stage for many days and the customer tries to cancel it, it receives the following error message in OMS:

    Â switchQualifier:cancel-order Vtex.Commerce.Checkout.Services.Gateway.GatewayTransactionCancellationException: Cancelation operation has returned Fail.

In the transaction logs, it is possible to notice that in the payload the transactionID was not informed/generated, which means that the transaction cannot be canceled since this field is mandatory to perform this action on the MaxiPago side. That payment never reached the acquirer.

Response from connector:

    CancelResponse: <api-error> <errorCode>1</errorCode> <errorMsg>Schema validation for the vertical SA for the incoming transaction xml failed. Reason Parser Error: URI=null Line=1: cvc-complex-type.2.4.b: The content of element 'void' is not complete. One of '{transactionID, customerId, customerIdExt, ipAddress}' is expected.</errorMsg> </api-error>

##### Error code:

    Connector Code: 1 - Message: Schema validation for the vertical SA for the incoming transaction xml failed. Reason Parser Error: URI=null Line=1: cvc-complex-type.2.4.b: The content of element 'void' is not complete.
