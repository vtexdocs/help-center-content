## Summary


The payment is finished and the transaction remains stuck on canceling status after the risk analysis is rejected.



##

## Simulation


When the auto-settle process occurs before the risk analysis is complete, the payment status is updated to "finished," while the transaction remains in the "analysing risk" state.

If the risk analysis results in a "risk-rejected" outcome, the cancellation process is triggered. However, once a transaction has been settled, it cannot be canceledâ€”only refunded.

As a result, transactions get stuck in the "canceling" status, even after a successful refund, while the payment status remains "finished."


##

## Workaround



Cancel the order manually on the OMS to prevent any issues with inventory management.
