## Summary


When using the CMS file manager in the account admin, there is an option for you to upload files:

 ![](https://vtexhelp.zendesk.com/attachments/token/tIFD30VhzhOuxTIV0f7UurtEH/?name=image.png) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Catalog/svg-file-replacement-with-the-same-name-doesnt-work_1.png)

When upload .SVG files, if you choose to replace an older file, by using the same name, the following display will be prompted:

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/Catalog/svg-file-replacement-with-the-same-name-doesnt-work_2.png)

However, the content of such file is never updating when using this method.


##

## Simulation


1 - Get 2 .SVG files with the same name.
2 - upload file #1 and check its content
3 - upload file #2 and check its content, even after days, it will not have been overwritten.


##

## Workaround


Delete the former file before uploading again.
