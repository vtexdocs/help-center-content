## Summary


Currently, some accounts, when attempting to update component prices for a KIT, will not experience the final kit price being automatically calculated and updated when changing said prices.


##

## Simulation


This issue only happens with a few select accounts. If it does, simply changing a component price and not seeing it reflect directly in the kit price is sufficient to say you are affected by this KI.


##

## Workaround


Update the SKUKit price directly, calculating the final price, instead of individually using the components to update.
