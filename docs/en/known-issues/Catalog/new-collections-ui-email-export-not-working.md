## Summary


Currently, when attempting to use the export via email, in the new collections module, the functionality will not yield any results.


##

## Simulation


1 - Access the new collections module, in any created collection https://account.myvtex.com/admin/collections/

2 - Go to the export tab

3 - There are 2 options, one to export directly in the UI (Download to computer) and other to export via email

4 - try using the export via email functionality

5 - A loading screen will show indefinitely and the email will never arrive

6 - eventually, a timeout error will be shown


##

## Workaround


Use the "Download to computer" functionality instead
