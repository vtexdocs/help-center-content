## Summary


Currently, the availability check display in the catalog admin has 3 different types of color to signalize the availability of an item:

Green = active and available for purchase
Red = active, but unavailable for purchase
Blank = inactive

However, the Red status only considers the availability for the default sales channel of the store (usually sc=1). Hence, if an item is available for other sales channels but not the default, it should still display a green tag, but it instead displays as red.


##

## Simulation


1 - For a store with multiple sales channels, create a product with availability for a sales channel other than sc=1
2 - Check its catalog availability visual tag, the one that can be seen in the catalog listing

3 - even with the item available for other sales channels, such as sc=2, the tag will only go green if its active and available for sc=1.
