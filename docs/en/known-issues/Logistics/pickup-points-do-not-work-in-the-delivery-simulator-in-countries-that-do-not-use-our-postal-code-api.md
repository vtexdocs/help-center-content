## Summary



The delivery simulator does not work with pick-up points in countries that do not use our postal code API.

To check if a country uses our postal code API, you need to contact support.


##

## Simulation



Make a shipping simulation (/admin/logistics#/freight-simulation), and the pickup point will not appear as an option.


##

## Workaround


It will not affect the pickup point operation in the store, and the pickup point should work correctly in the checkout.
