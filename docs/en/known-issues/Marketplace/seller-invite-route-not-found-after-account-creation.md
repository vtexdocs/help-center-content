## Summary


In this process, we generate a VTEX account for these sellers, which is the Seller Portal. Account creation is a self-service process, that is, the seller himself provides the data through a form and, when submitting, we create the account. Once the account is created, the seller is immediately redirected to their admin.


##

## Simulation




- go to Seller Invite flow on: https://VTEX.myvtex.com/admin/seller-invite/
- register a new Seller Portal account.
- finish registration of a Seller Portal account

**ERROR**

    {"code":"NotFound","message":"Route test21nov2569.myvtex.com/_v/segment/admin-login/v1/login?returnUrl=/admin&email=andrei.basoc+test21nov2@vtex.com not found","source":"Vtex.Kube.Router","requestId":"f19875630eac47a588b2e32250292f4a"}

## Workaround


There is a delay in provisioning the account, as, after some time, this error normalizes, that is, the account becomes accessible to the seller.
