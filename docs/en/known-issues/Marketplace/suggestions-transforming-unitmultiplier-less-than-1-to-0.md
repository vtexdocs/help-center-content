## Summary



The seller can send unitMultilplier values for it's skus that are bellow 1.

Example:

The same info is sent to the marketplace correctly:

However, once the product is processed by the Matcher, the value is rounded to 0:

And once is approved to the marketplace catalog, the value continues as 0. That way a wrong value is set on the marketplace's catalog.


##

## Simulation



1. Create a sku with a unitMultiplier value as less than 1;
2. Send it to the marketplace;
3. Approve the sku on the marketplace's received skus area;
4. Check on the marketplace's catalog that the value is set as 0.


##

## Workaround


Adjust the value directly on the marketplace's catalog via Admin, spreadsheet or API.
