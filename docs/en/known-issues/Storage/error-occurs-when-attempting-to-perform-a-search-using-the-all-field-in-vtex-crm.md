## Summary


This case happens with entities containing a large number of fields and millions of records in an entity. The problem arises due to the search engine using the “All” field, which sends individual requests for each searchable field of the entity and multiplies the request load for each document.


##

## Simulation



1. Access `https://.vtexcrm.com.br/`.
2. Navigate to a view that represents an entity with millions of records.
3. Initiate a search using the "All" field.

4. Observe the system's response and check if it returns an error or experiences significant performance issues.

5. Repeat the search with a specific searchable field to confirm if the issue is related to the "All" field's search mechanism.
