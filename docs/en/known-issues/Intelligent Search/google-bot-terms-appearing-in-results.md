## Summary


The Intelligent Search reports show terms queried by Google Bot. It's expected this to be filtered out.

**Note:** This Known Issue is no longer applied because Intelligent Search filters out terms from known bots. However, Intelligent Search reports still can show terms from either automated or non-automated access to previously known URLs.
