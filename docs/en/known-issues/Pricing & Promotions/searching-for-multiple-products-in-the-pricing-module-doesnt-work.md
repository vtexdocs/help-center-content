## Summary


Currently, if you try to filter for multiple products at one in the pricing's search bar, the filter will stop working and present products as if no filters were originally used.


##

## Simulation


1 - In the pricing module https://myaccount.myvtex.com/admin/pricing#/prices, try searching for a single product and the presented results will work.

2 - now, try adding more products to the search bar and not only the original product won't be shown, but also the filter will be totally ignored (same result as applying no filter at all)

3 - The final result should look something like the image below, where the presented products are not the exact 3 that were filtered for, but the original list

## Workaround


Filter for products individually
