## Summary


If you create a route in your theme's `routes.json` file, the route will not be deleted from the admin.


##

## Simulation


Create a page on your themes under the routes.json file:
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/known-issues/CMS/when-deleting-routes-from-the-routesjson-file-they-are-not-deleted-from-the-ui_1.png)

The page will be correctly created on the admin:

If you delete that route from the theme, the admin reference will still be there. But you will still be able to edit the routes on the admin.


##

## Workaround


You can open a ticket to the support team asking to delete those routes.
