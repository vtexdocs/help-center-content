## Summary


In some cases, a miscommunication error with the master data makes retrieving the latest live variant impossible, so an empty variant is created. This can make the page blank on the UI and in the final domain.


##

## Simulation


Eventually, after finalizing the release, an update to the content of a page on hCMS leaves the page blank.


##

## Workaround


Please open a ticket to PS CMS so that we can fix it with the latest content available.
