Formatting data consistently creates a clean, organized, and accessible experience.

### Country names

For country names, follow [https://countrycode.org/](https://countrycode.org/).

### Addresses

The standard US address has three lines: recipient; line one (street number and name), line two (unit or suite number), which is often optional; and line three (city, state, and postal code). Use the standard five-digit postal code. Don’t add the extra four digits unless automatically generated by an address confirmation system.

Write a comma between the city and state only. If an address has to be written in one line of text, put a comma after the street name and after the city.
