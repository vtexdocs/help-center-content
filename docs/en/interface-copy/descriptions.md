Descriptions use a single sentence to clarify or explain complex information or tasks to the user. This pattern is frequently found in form fields and help-related components.

## General

Include a description only when additional information is actually necessary.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :-------- |
| <ul><li>Label: Category</li><li>Label: Phone</li></ul> | <ul><li><p>Label: Category</p><p>Description: Complete the category</p></li><li><p>Label: Phone</p><p>Description: Example: +1-576-158-4127</p></li></ul> |

Keep it as short as possible while still being descriptive enough.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Volume of sessions in the intermediate stages of the purchase flow | This chart allows you to track the volume of sessions in the intermediate stages of the purchase flow and view opportunities for optimizing the conversion rate |

Use sentence case, but capitalize proper nouns.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li>Schedule for updates</li><li>Seller identifier in the marketplace</li><li>Performance analysis of all VTEX Shipping Network carriers</li></ul> | <ul><li>Schedule for Updates</li><li>Seller identifier in the Marketplace</li><li>Performance analysis of all VTEX shipping network carriers</li></ul> |

Avoid punctuation such as commas, and don't use periods or question marks.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Day in which the changes made will be published considering the time zone where the store is located | Considering the time zone where the store is located, the day in which the changes made will be published. |

Don't include redundant words.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li>Label: Frequency</li><li>Description: Schedule for updates</li></ul> | <ul><li>Label: Frequency</li><li>Description: Frequency for updates</li></ul> |

Don't use a marketing tone of voice or explain benefits.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Volume of sessions in the intermediate stages of the purchase flow | Track the volume of sessions in the intermediate stages of the purchase flow to optimize your conversion rate |

## Specific

When explaining a label, write as if completing the sentence "This is the…". Start with a noun followed by additional information, such as conditions and definitions.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li><p>Label: Seller ID</p><p>Description: Seller identifier in the marketplace</p></li><li><p>Label: Frequency</p><p>Description: Schedule for updates</p></li><li><p>Label: Privacy policy</p><p>Description: Declaration of the parties that manage customer data</p></li><li><p>Label: Publish date</p><p>Description: Day in which the changes made will appear in the store</p></li></ul> | <ul><li><p>Label: Seller ID</p><p>Description: This is the seller identifier in the marketplace</p></li><li><p>Label: Frequency</p><p>Description: Frequency is the schedule for updates</p></li><li><p>Label: Privacy policy</p><p>Description: Fill a declaration of which parties manage customer data</p></li><li><p>Label: Publish date</p><p>Description: When should the changes appear in the store?</p></li></ul> |

When explaining how information given in a form field will be used, write as if completing the sentence "When you enter a value in this field, it…" and start with a verb in the simple present tense.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li><p>Label: Seller ID</p><p>Description: Appears to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Frequency</p><p>Description: Defines when updates will be published</p></li><li><p>Label: Privacy policy</p><p>Description: Appears to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Publish date</p><p>Description: Considers the time zone where the store is located</p></li></ul> | <ul><li><p>Label: Seller ID</p><p>Description: When you fill a value in this field, it appears to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Frequency</p><p>Description: Frequency defines when updates will be published</p></li><li><p>Label: Privacy policy</p><p>Description: This appears to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Publish date</p><p>Description: Consider the time zone where the store is located</p></li></ul> |

When explaining both the label of a form field and how its value will be used, combine the two sentences described in the previous topics and adapt them if necessary.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| <ul><li><p>Label: Seller ID</p><p>Description: Seller identifier in the marketplace that appears to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Frequency</p><p>Description: Schedule for updates that defines when they will be published</p></li><li><p>Label: Privacy policy</p><p>Description: Declaration of which parties manage customer data that will appear to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Publish date</p><p>Description: Day in which the changes made will be published considering the time zone where the store is located</p></li></ul> | <ul><li><p>Label: Seller ID</p><p>Description: Fill the seller identifier in the marketplace that will appear to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Frequency</p><p>Description: Frequency is the schedule for updates that defines when they will be published</p></li><li><p>Label: Privacy policy</p><p>Description: Declaration of which parties manage customer data that will appear to customers in the store</p></li><li><p>Label: Publish date</p><p>Description: When should the changes made be published, considering the time zone where the store is located?</p></li></ul> |
