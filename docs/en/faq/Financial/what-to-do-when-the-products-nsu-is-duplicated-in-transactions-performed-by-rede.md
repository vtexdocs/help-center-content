Some times, the [NSU](/tutorial/how-do-i-find-the-order-nsu-and-tid?locale=en) (Single Sequential Number) may be duplicated in the acquirer Rede. Errors like this can disrupt the conciliation process.

However, in circumstances where the NSU is the same for two different customers, an alternative to verify the transaction is to process the payment using the [TID](/tutorial/how-to-view-the-orders-details?locale=en) numbers, which are different from each other.

Note: it's important to understand that the NSU is not created by VTEX, but by the acquirer responsible for the transaction. Therefore, it's important to contact Rede's e-commerce team to solve the problem.
