The [DNS has been pointed](/en/tutorial/configuring-dns-pointing-to-vtex) and all the store URLs have been configured, but even so you cannot access the store? The problem may be in the __Account management__.

An essential step for a store to go into production is to configure this status in your account, in the __Account management__.

So if you access your store and cannot enter the e-commerce environment, and an error screen shows, check that your status is “production” in the __Account management__, [configuring it as in this tutorial](/en/tutorial/releasing-the-store-for-production/).

After you have configured the status, you will be able to access the store.
