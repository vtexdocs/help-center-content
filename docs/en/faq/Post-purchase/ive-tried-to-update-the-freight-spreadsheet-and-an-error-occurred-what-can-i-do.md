To perform a freight spreadsheet upgrade through spreadsheet import, it is necessary that the names of the columns are correct, in **.xls** format and, if the file exceeds 10MB, it must be compressed in the **.zip** format. For further details, see the following documents: [How to build a freight spreadsheet](/en/tutorial/building-a-freight-spreadsheet) and [Freight Values](/en/tutorial/editing-freight-values).

If you try to import a spreadsheet in **.xlsx** format, the freight will not be updated.

The ideal procedure is to always export the spreadsheet that is already saved on the platform, make the appropriate changes, and then import it back. This way, you can ensure that no error will occur, since the file will already be in the accepted format. To get the template, click on the **Spreadsheet Model Download link**, which is inside the carrier's settings screen.

Beacuse spreadsheets in **.xls** format have a limit of 65,536 rows, if you need to register a bigger file, create new tabs (sheets), that contain the same header, and fill them out with the remaining lines, since every time you import a new file, it overwrites the last one.
