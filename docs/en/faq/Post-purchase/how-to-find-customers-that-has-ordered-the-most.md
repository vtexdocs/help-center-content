Currently VTEX does not have a report that lists store's end-consumers that has more orders.

Typically this information can obtained in ERPs, as they centralize all invoicing management.

However, at VTEX you can access the **Orders** module and [export your orders](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/exportacao-de-pedidos-no-modulo-pedidos--tutorials_6417). With this data, you may craft your own report into a spreadsheet.
