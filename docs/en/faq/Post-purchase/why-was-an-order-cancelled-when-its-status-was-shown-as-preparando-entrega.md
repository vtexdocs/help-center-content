Any order can be cancelled before it is shown as `Invoiced`.

When cancellation happens, the user is notified through [VTEX DO](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/vtex-do-interface--7KMbRL4OslN8DTX9oiuCiu). Thus, depending on the stage of the delivery, the user can confirm or reverse cancellation: 

1) If you want to confirm the cancellation, in **Orders > All Orders**, click the desired order and click **Cancel Order**.

2) If you want to go ahead with fulfillment, follow with the invoicing, informing the customer that the order cannot be canceled.

>❗ Under `Cancellation Window` status, only the customer’s cancellation request is unilateral, and the store does not confirm. In all other statuses, the store will be informed of the request through VTEX DO.
