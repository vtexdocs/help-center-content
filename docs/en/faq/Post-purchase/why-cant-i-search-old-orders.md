The OMS module offers a range of filtering options for an order. However, when related to the period, your searches must be done with a range of __up to 6 months__.

For example, if you want to fetch an order made on April 2016, you can use April - October in the filter. With a period greater than that, the search will not work.

## You can also do these searches by period:

__Delivery date:__ expected delivery date of the order. It has fixed fields in link format, with the number of orders in parentheses.

__Billing date:__ date the order was billed. It has fixed fields in link format so that the search can be performed as follows: *today, yesterday, a week ago, current month, a month ago or using the calendar.*

__Authorization date:__ date when the order was authorized by the payment gateway. It has fixed fields in link format so that the search can be performed as follows: *today, yesterday, a week ago, current month, a month ago or using the calendar.*
