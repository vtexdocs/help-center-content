Orders made with Visa Checkout are closed outside VTEX checkout.

As a result, customers who make a first purchase at the store do not have their profile saved on VTEX Profile System. This way, the user can not access their orders in __My Orders__ section.

For customers already registered at the store, you can access __My Orders__ section and view all orders placed, including those closed through Visa Checkout.

>ℹ️ The customer email saved in VTEX must be the same as the one used for signing in to Visa Checkout so that orders can be viewed in **My Orders**.
