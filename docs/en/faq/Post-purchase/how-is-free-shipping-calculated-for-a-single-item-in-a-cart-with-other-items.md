The Free Shipping app follows the same logic as the sharing of shipping charges. Let us take the example in the article on [shipping sharing](/pt/faq/como-e-feito-o-rateio-de-frete), where product **A** has a free shipping promotion.

In this example, let us suppose the shipping value is made up as follows:

- Product A = 20% = R$5.00
- Product B = 17.50% = R$4.38
- Product C = 5.00% = R$1.25
- Product D = 45.00% = R$11.25
- Product E = 12.50% = R$3.13

**Total shipping** = R$25.00

If the shipping for **A** is free, then the total cost will be **R$20,00**
