The message "A planilha contém valores inválidos, por favor verifique a linha X coluna Y. erro: The TimeSpan could not be parsed because at least one of the numeric components is out of range or contains too many digits." normally appears when the TimeCost column starts with `00.`, i.e. when the cost time is less than 1 day.

In this case, to correct it you must delete the value `00.`, leaving only the values for hours, minutes and seconds. For example: `00.24:00:00` leave only `24:00:00`.
