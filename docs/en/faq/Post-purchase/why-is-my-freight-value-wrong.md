Freight calculation is based on several factors: freight table, additional freight and sales. When it becomes necessary to verify the calculation of the total freight, you must perform the steps below.

## Logistics

1. Perform a [shipping simulation](/en/tutorial/freight-simulation/);
2. Click on the **Show Details** link.
3. Here, you can see the value registered on the spreadsheet, as well as all [additionals](/en/tutorial/understanding-the-additional-freight) added to this value.
4. If the value is not consistent with the one displayed at the store, follow the steps below to check if there isn't a sale altering the value of the freight.

## Sale
