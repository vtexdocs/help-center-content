For most integrations with marketplaces ( and all those configured by the Bridge), the marketplace does not use the seller’s payment methods. This means that the marketplace processes the payment using its own payment methods and then passes the amount agreed on to the seller.

In other words, payment is made on the marketplace using the marketplace’s payment methods. Thus, the seller’s payment methods will not show up and will have no impact on the marketplace’s purchase process.

For example: A purchase made by the CNova marketplace will be displayed on your OMS, under **Payment**, with the following message: "Assumed value by affiliate CNova (NVP)", as illustrated below.
