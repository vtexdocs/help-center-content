When you delink a Seller SKU, it will **no longer be shown as available** in the Marketplace.

The SKU will be delinked from the catalogue and thereafter will no longer be updated, e.g. in terms of seller’s price and stocks.

If you click on the flag **desvincular**, the Seller SKU will no longer be included in the Suggested SKU for approval and return to the catalogue.

When you delink an SKU, it will simply stop being shown in the store and receiving price and stock notifications.

_Note: A delinked SKU will not return to the queue for approval in Suggestion, since it already exists in the catalogue._

If what you want is to remove a Seller SKU because it is showing the wrong image, wrong name, wrong details etc. and you want it to be reentered in SKU Suggestion for approval in the correct manner, you must delete the Seller SKU.
