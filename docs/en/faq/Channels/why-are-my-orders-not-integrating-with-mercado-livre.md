In the case of Mercado Livre, when an integration token is deactivated - no matter the reason - the orders placed on that marketplace are not sent to the VTEX platform. To solve this issue, the answer is quite simple: you will have to redo the integration process.

In order to do this, the first step is accessing the integration registration:

1. Access the __Marketplace__ module
2. Click on __Integration__
3. Look for the Mercado Livre __panel__
4. Click on the __gears__ icon <img class="shadow-4" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/faq/Channels/why-are-my-orders-not-integrating-with-mercado-livre_1.png" />
5. Click on __Edit config_

From there onwards, you'll need to redo the integration process.

6. Click on the __deactivate__ button
7. Select __Save configuration__

Wait for about 15 minutes, then proceed with the following:

8. Access the __integration registration__ page. Repeat the first five steps on this tutorial.
9. Click on __activate__
10. Click on __save configuration__

Having done this, wait for 15 more minutes. The most important step of this process begins now:

11. Access the Mercado Livre __panel__
12. __Login__ with the account you wish to integrate
13. Redo the __[authorization process](/en/tracks/--2YfvI3Jxe0CGIKoWIGQEIq/4leBEAd22Icm46kGeiGgak)__
14. __Save__ the configurations.

Done! By doing this, your integration will go back to working normally after a few minutes.
