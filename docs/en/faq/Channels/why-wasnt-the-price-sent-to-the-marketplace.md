Sending of prices to the marketplace depends on two processes: prior cataloging of the integrated products, which is done by the marketplace, and the integration itself. See below how to identify what is preventing the integration of prices with the marketplace.

## Check the Integrations module

The first step to understanding the reason why the price was not integrated with the marketplace is [to check the integration status of the orders on the Integrations.](/en/tutorial/checking-integrations-in-bridge)

In addition, it is recommended checking whether all the [steps for configuring the price have been followed](/en/tutorial/integrating-with-marketplace).

## Understand cataloging

There is also the possibility that cataloging is still in progress when the product is being sent and, when this happens, the price cannot be integrated yet. That is why you must wait for [cataloging by the marketplace](/en/faq/why-were-products-not-sent-to-the-marketplace/) then get in touch directly with the marketplace if you have any doubts.

## How do I solve this

For all scenarios, the recommendation is to [have the Integrations reprocess the price](/en/tutorial/checking-integrations-in-bridge).
