When you delete a Seller SKU, it is removed from the Marketplace catalogue. This means that **it will no longer appear in the list of SKUs**.

The SKU excluded will only appear in the catalogue if the seller resends it to Suggestion. In this case, it can be approved again and be actively registered in the Marketplace.
