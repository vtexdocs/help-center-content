When trying to accept the suggestion of an SKU, the marketplace may receive the following error:

`We could not process the suggestion`

This happens when there is some error in the SKU registration in the seller.

To identify what the error is, follow the steps below:
1. Enter the __Suggestions__ module.
2. Click the SKU that the marketplace did not accept.![erroSuggestion1](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/2T4ywpCeacosAGoQCS0k4M/f27f1729b879a02cd11f5bc916c8f8a6/erroSuggestion1.png)
3. Enter the browser __developer tools__ (for this, if you are using Google Chrome, press `F12` on Windows or` Command + Option + I` on the Mac).
4. In the developer tools, click the __Network__ tab.
5. Still in the developer tools, click the option __All__.![erroSuggestion2](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/tXLZF0IEO4KKa6O4WuQg6/58adc90c3afa5ce2d02238079cabd958/erroSuggestion2.png)
6. Click the __Activate__ button of the Suggestions module.
