To create a promotion for marketplaces, the scenario is almost the same as that for usual promotions. However, you must select, in the **política comercial** field, the value **Loja(s) de terceiro(s)** and select the trade policy applied by the marketplace, or fill out the **afiliado **field with the Id of the marketplace.

For more details on how to do so, check [our article on how to create a promotion for the marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-promocao-para-marketplace/).

Remember!  After that, check whether some additional promotion filter was created, such as form of payment, cluster or shopping cart limit filters. The form of payment filter, for example, can only be applied in settings where the seller’s forms of payment are used. These settings are less usual, being applied in just a few marketplaces.
