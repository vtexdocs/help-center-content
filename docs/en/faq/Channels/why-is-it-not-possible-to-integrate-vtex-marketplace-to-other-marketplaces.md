We may point out some reasons for that:

- In first place, there is a business rule which should be taken into account. A marketplace selling at another marketplace would imply selling third-party products without authorization.
- Some technical issues also make it difficult to properly conduct this kind of integration, such as the lack of prices attributed to the products catalog. Even if it were created, a very thorough management process would be necessary in order to always reflect changes made by the seller.
- Another reason is the fact that today a VTEX store acting as a marketplace is able to choose whether to process payments with its own methods, with the seller&#8217;s methods or even with a mix of both. An external source cannot reach two layers deep and request this type of information. This means it would be impossible to capture the payment conditions set by the seller.
