The promotion seal is a flag that appears at the front end of the store. For this flag to appear, there needs to be a tag on the HTML which is read by the CSS for display.

In other words, this configuration is only valid for the VTEX store, since the configuration depends on the store front and not on the integration of products and prices.

In any promotion, the information relayed to the marketplace is the value of the product, with the discount of the promotions registered for it already factored in.

Therefore, it has to be configured directly by the marketplace, in case there is some rule about promotions displaying the stamp.
