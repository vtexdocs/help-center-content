Regarding the integration with Magazine Luiza, it's possible that some of the orders placed on the page of this marketplace end up not integrating on VTEX, which stymies the completion of the sales cycle. 

In the case of Magazine Luiza, the retailer can create a Tolerance Percentage, establishing a difference between the seller created product value and the the actual marketplace value at which the product is sold.

Both not filling out the Tolerance Percentage field or not configuring it properly may affect the process.

However, it is possible to remedy this through VTEX admin.

Check out the following step-by-step:

1. Return to __main menu__
2. Access the __Integrations__ module again
3. Select __Orders__
4. Click on the order highlighted in __red__
5. Select __Actions__ (blue button)
6. Click on __Ignore divergence and process__

Your orders should now be correctly integrated with Magazine Luiza marketplace.
