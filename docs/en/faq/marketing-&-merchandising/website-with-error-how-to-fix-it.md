An issue that affects the indexation of products in the store is the absence of a connection between the site and a Binding.

To check this, just have a look at the color of your website (the little globe) inside the CMS's __Layout__ section. If it's blue, everything is OK and you don’t have to worry.

However, if it's yellow, it means there is an error.

Below are the steps to adjust it:

1. Click on the website.
2. Select the Binding on the screen (line highlighted in the image below), and click on __Update__.![Binding 1](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/5LR7a32CjuCISemEqiUCcW/ad11100f7da9727f1fccaa3adf16ae39/Binding_1.png)
3. On the screen displayed, the __Store name from License Manager__ field will be blank; click on the arrow that appears in this field and select the name of your store.
4. Click on __Save Binding__.![Binding 2](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/27JCHH8IOIgwQY2qaQ0MIU/de9d5bdde8cdfa57a5c08a0ae8291506/Binding_2.png)
5. Click on __Websites__ again to update the page, and that’s it! The little globe will appear in blue, which means that now this is right.
