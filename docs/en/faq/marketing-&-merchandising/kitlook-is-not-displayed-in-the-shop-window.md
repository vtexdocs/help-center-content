Lookbook Creation: it's possible that the product images will not appear in the shop window, even if they have already been inputed.

This can happen because of the Label. This identification works like a "tag" that organizes your site's page template.

__Attention__: it's worth noting that the Label field is mandatory and does not support the use of special characters, accents or blanks.

As much as the store sets up all products and their respective SKUs, if the Label field is empty, the Lookbook view does not work.

Bellow, learn how to set this feature up.

__Fill in the Label field__

1. Access the __Catalog__;
2. Click __Products and SKUs__;
3. Click the __product__ you want to set up;
4. Go to the __Images__ tab;
5. Enter a term to populate the __Label__;

  ![Kit Look - Label - EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/7FR879Lzl3eEDmAHiBV0TV/2789e7a69d5258c78d192a47ecc2aff5/7FR879Lzl3eEDmAHiBV0TV_en.jpg)

6. Click __Save__.

Done! Your Lookbook should display all images correctly after this procedure. Do not forget to save the Label code, otherwise the setting will not be updated.
