It is usual for the store to make changes to the placeholders of a layout in the CMS module, and that such change is not reflected live.

Usually this happens because the store saves the placeholder after the changes but does not save the layout.

Whenever you change a placeholder, remember to:
1. Save the placeholder.![savePlaceholder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/faq/marketing-&-merchandising/ive-edited-a-placeholder-and-the-site-hasnt-been-updated-what-to-do_1.png)
2. Save the layout.![saveLayout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/refs/heads/main/docs/en/faq/marketing-&-merchandising/ive-edited-a-placeholder-and-the-site-hasnt-been-updated-what-to-do_2.png)
