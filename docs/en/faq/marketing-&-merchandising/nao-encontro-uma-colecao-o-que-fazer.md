> ⚠️ **Warning:** there are two ways to configure collections, through the CMS or the Collection module (Beta). This article is about how to <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-collections-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L">configure collections through the CMS</a>.

By default, the CMS module only displays the __last 20 collections__ updated.

So if your store has more than 20 collections, it's normal for some of them not to appear in the list shown in the CMS.

But you can fetch any collection using the __search field__ (Find), including those that are not displayed by default.
