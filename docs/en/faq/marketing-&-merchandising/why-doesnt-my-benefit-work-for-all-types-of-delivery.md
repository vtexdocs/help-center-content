In a free shipping benefit, if you don't specify the delivery type in the Admin, __the benefit will be applied only to the cheapest type available__.

To specify the type of delivery to which you want to apply the benefit, you must define, in the conditions for the benefit to be valid, the type of shipping chosen.

1. Enter the __Rates & benefits__ module.
2. Click on the card of the benefit to which you want to apply the free shipping.
3. In item 3, activate the __Shipping Method__ flag and specify which ones should receive the free shipping.

Once this has been done, the specified shipping types will enter the promotion and will appear to the customer with free shipping available.

You can also activate the __Apply selected discount only when one of the above carriers is selected by the customer__ flag. In such case, the benefit will be applied to all shipping types selected by the customer.
