Registering the tracking on the tax receipt requires the following fields in order to function:

- Tracking number  
- Tracking URL   
- Carrier  

After the registration, analyze the following items, which are the primary causes of this scenario:

- Check whether the tracking number is incorrect
- Check whether the tracking URL is incorrect
- Check whether the transport company is incorrect
- Access the tracking URL by entering the number on the browser and check whether you are accessing the tracking monitoring page
- Check whether the transport company is on the [list of companies registered for tracking](/en/faq/which-transport-companies-enable-make-it-possible-to-track-delivery).

_Adjust these items and follow up the triggering of the e-mails using the time line in the order._
