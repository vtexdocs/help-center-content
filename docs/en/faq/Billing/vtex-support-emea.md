Keep in mind that our first response time calculation is based on working hours. The criteria for ticket urgency are defined in the section below.  

>⚠️ Emergency support will be available **exclusively** for Urgent requests and provided via [Zendesk tickets](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM). Urgent requests are defined as problems that directly prevent sales or the store's operation, as described in [Ticket Urgency](#ticket-urgency).

## Ticket urgency

Urgent tickets report critical problems that have a direct impact on sales. The table below lists the scenarios we consider when classifying ticket urgency.



## Ticket Priorities

The following table lists the scenarios we consider when ranking ticket priority based on how the ticket forms were filled out.  



The priority of a ticket may change over time, based on VTEX's analysis of the impact of the request. You can check the priority of your open requests through the [support panel](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en/requests).
