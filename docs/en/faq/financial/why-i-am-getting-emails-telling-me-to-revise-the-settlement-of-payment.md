This usually happens when the VTEX Payments gets an invalid response when requesting the settlement of a transaction by the integrator (e.g.: Cielo, Redecard).

In this case, you must contact the store integrator and check whether or not the payment was successfully settled.

The alert email sent by the system includes useful information about the authorization of the transaction, which must be supplied to the connector’s support team.
