This is the final stage of development.

Once the developer has tested their app and is sure that everything is OK, they can promote the workspace to master.

That is, so far the following steps have been followed:
1. Install the app in the development workspace.
2. Setup the app.
3. Test the app.
4. Put the workspace in `production true` status.
5. Promote the workspace to master.

As a result, the data in this workspace becomes available to the end user.
