When a VTEX store is created, it receives an account.

This account is identified by the AccountName that appears in the URL through which you accees your Admin.

For example, if your AccountName is "mystore", the access URL to your Admin is `https://mystore.myvtex.com/admin`

Each account is accessible by users who are granted access permissions to specific modules of the platform.

To start developing in VTEX IO, you need to log in to a VTEX account. This is the only way to access workspaces, install apps, and take any other action you need to view, edit, and build applications.

If you already have access to a store account, simply login.
