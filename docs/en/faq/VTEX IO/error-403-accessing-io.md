In the course of your experience with VTEX.IO, you may receive a `403 (Forbidden)` error indicating that your access is being denied.

The first step in solving this problem is to contact VTEX support team and request that your domain be added to our whitelist.

__If you are already on the white list and continue to receive the error message, install the vtex.builder-hub. on a new workspace and promote it to master.__
