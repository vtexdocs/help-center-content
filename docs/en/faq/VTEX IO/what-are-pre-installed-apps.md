The first time you access your account through VTEX IO CLI, you will see there are already a few apps there.

They have been previously installed and are responsible for performing some basic functions.

![appList](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/23dywoz95GmeAOkuwe8WWq/d1097f363859c30abd67e699fa0d23ed/appList.png)

For example:
- __admins-app__: renders the page of the new VTEX administrative panel.
- __extension-store__: Our apps marketplace (/admin/extensions/explore).
- __toolbet__: interface between the developer and the IO.
- __colossus-legacy-proxy__: Compatibility service between the IO domain (\*.myvtex.com) and the portal (\*.vtexcommercestable.com.br).
