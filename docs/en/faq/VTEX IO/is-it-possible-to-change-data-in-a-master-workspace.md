__No__. A master workspace is in production, that is, it corresponds to the version that is available to the end user.

The status of a workspace that's in master is `production true`.

You can not make changes to this workspace.

Instead, work the new code on another workspace, then change the status of that workspace to `production true` and then promote it.

>⚠️ You can not make changes to a master workspace.
