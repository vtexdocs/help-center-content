When an app is linked (`vtex link`), its files are sent to the Registry, and you get to see the changes in your code in real time.

This is an intermediary state of development, in which the code is still attached to the developer's computer.

It allows you to instantly test changes to published and unpublished apps.

You can understand the _link_ as a soft [installation](http://help.vtex.com/en/faq/what-does-installing-an-app-mean). Once you _unlink_ your app, it will be gone from your workspace.
