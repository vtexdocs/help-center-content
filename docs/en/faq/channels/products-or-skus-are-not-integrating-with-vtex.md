When a store has problems with the ERP, it often happens that there are difficulties with sending products and SKUs to VTEX. However, since integration is handled by the ERP, by the store or by a partner agency, you must find out from this developer how to check logs and how to correct the problem.

In the case of ERPs, VTEX takes no active part in the integration, but just waits for the products to be sent. Accordingly, you must check who designed the integration and what the problem is.
