In VTEX, the last status of an order flow is `Billed`. In this status the __tracking data__ and the __invoice__ of the order are provided.

Thus, for marketplaces that have some status which comes after `Billed` (such as `Delivered to Carrier` and `Delivered`) the progress for these other statuses must be made directly by the marketplace system.
