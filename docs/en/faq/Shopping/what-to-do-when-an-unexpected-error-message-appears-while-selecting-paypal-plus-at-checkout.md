At the checkout, if the customer selects __PayPal Plus__ as a payment condition, the message _erro inesperado_ ("unexpected error") may be displayed on the screen. This is a rare and intermittent event, but it can still trouble your customers at a key moment during shopping experience.


## Why does it happen?
Browsers are increasingly gaining security mechanisms to protect user information. This includes stricter policies regarding the use of cookies.

Some payment conditions, such as [PayPal Plus (transparent)](/en/tutorial/setting-up-paypal-plus), make calls to the checkout API that depend on sending cookies. This sending may be blocked by browser security settings, which causes interface errors.


## How to solve it
For now, the problem can only be solved if the user edits their browser settings. They must enable the option that allows other websites to access the cookies of the store in which they're making the purchase.

We recommend that if a customer contacts your store reporting this type of behavior, you should tell them to adjust their browser's cookie settings.
