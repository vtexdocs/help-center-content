When you enter the cart in your store, an error may appear on the screen with the message `Store not found`. 

This error indicates there's probably a flaw in your store's Account management setting. 

To adjust these settings, follow the step-by-step below:

1. In the Admin menu, click __Account Management__.
2. Access the __Accounts__ option.
3. Click your account.
4. Verify that the value contained in the `Store Name` field is also in the `Hosts` field. If not, include in the `Hosts` field the value found in the `Store Name` field.
5. Click __Save__.
