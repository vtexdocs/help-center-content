VTEX ID has a rule to stop users trying to misuse another person’s login, so that after 3 incorrect tries the email is blocked for __1 hour__.

At the end of this time it is automatically unblocked, but it is impossible to do this manually.

This applies both to the store’s customers and to administrative access, and even to the APIs.
