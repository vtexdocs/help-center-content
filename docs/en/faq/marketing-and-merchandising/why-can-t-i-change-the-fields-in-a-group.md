At VTEX, products are created on the platform according to category hierarchy, meaning that items of a store are organized in groups, categories and subgatories, in a system that is subjugated to another until reaching the "parent category".

This hierarchy thus influences product configuration, where "subcategories" carry "parent category" information.

Consequently, the fields a "subcategory" receives cannot be edited in the category itself. This occurs because the fields can only be edited in their category of origin - the "parent category".

However, it is quite easy to make changes in a group. The first step is finding the origin of the field creation, where the `edit` options becomes visible.

Once that field has been located, follow the instructions below:

1. Access the __Catalog__ module
2. Click on __Categories__

3. Click on __Actions__
4. Select __Product Fields__

5. Find the __group__ you wish to make changes to
6. Click on __Edit__

7. After performing the required changes, click on __Save__

Done, fields have been changed! Don't forget to save the settings for the changes to be displayed on your store's front end.
