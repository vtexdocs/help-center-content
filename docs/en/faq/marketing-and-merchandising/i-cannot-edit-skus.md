If you're having trouble editing your SKUs, it's possible that one of the following scenarios is occurring:

1. Some product or SKU field has been populated with invalid values.
2. Any mandatory data is missing from the SKU registration.
3. The product has reached the limit of registered SKUs.

In these scenarios, it is common to see the following error message: `Error connecting to the backend server`.

If your SKUs have been uploaded to VTEX via integration, check with your integrator if the fields are filled with the correct values. To know the values expected by VTEX, [access our article](/en/tutorial/integration-guide-for-erps-full-catalog) about integrations with the Catalog.

If your product has reached the limit of registered SKUs, we suggest reviewing your product categorization. We allow a maximum of 50 SKUs per product.
