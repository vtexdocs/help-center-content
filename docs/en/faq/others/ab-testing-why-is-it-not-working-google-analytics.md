Usually, this situation happens because the store owner is not able to save the script generated by Analytics inside the Template.

To solve this problem, just follow the steps below:

1. Create a contentPlaceHolder inside the Template.
2. On the page on which AB Testing is being applied, create an HTML-type control and save the script.

This way, AB Testing will be successful.

See below the screens with examples of the steps:
