The list works as a store catalog, except for the fact that the products are selected for and by a specific cliente.

Based on this principle, it is easy to understand that we do not hinder the purchase of a given product on a list after it has been purchased – by definition, the catalog will only block the purchase if the product cannot be delivered.

In other words, the information on the “quantity desired” of a product on the list may or may not be taken into account by clients upon making a purchase. Our conduct is to ask about the quantity desired and the quantity already purchased. So, purchasing the same item is possible.

However, if you want your store to block the access to the purchase of a product that has already reached the quantity desired, you may include a Js on the page, which, after identifying that the item has already been purchased and the number of items purchased, will hide the **Comprar** button.
