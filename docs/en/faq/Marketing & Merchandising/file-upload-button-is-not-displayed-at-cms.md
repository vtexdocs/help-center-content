There are frequent reports of users who are unable to upload files, images or collections to the CMS because the Send button is not shown, or who receive an "HTTP Error" message.

If you have this problem on Google Chrome, just activate the Flash plug-in as follows:

1. Click on the information button or on the padlock in front of the current URL;
2. In the line corresponding to the Flash, which normally shows "Perguntar (padr√£o)", select "Sempre permitir neste site".

Normally this problem is related to the availability of Flash Player on the browser for the site accessed. 

Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge have the Flash plug-in built in, and it does not have to be installed, but sometimes it has to be activated manually. Other browsers require Flash to be installed separately.
