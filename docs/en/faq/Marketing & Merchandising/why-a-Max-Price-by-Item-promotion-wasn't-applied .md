As mentioned in our tutorial on [Creating a max price per item promotion](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/--tutorials_3221), in order to enable this type of promotion, choosing a __choose a payment method__ option is mandatory.

As such, the payment condition criteria should be met in order for the Max Price by Item Promotion to take effect. Hence, we have concluded that the Max Price by Item Promotion __would only influece the cart value after the customer chooses a payment method at Checkout__.
