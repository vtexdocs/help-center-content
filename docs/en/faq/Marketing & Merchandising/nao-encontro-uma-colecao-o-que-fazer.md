>⚠️ **Warning:** there are two ways to configure collections, through the CMS or the Collection module (Beta). This article is about how to <a href = "https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/adding-collections-cms--2YBy6P6X0NFRpkD2ZBxF6L">configure collections through the CMS</a>.

By default, the CMS module only displays the __last 20 collections__ updated.

So if your store has more than 20 collections, it's normal for some of them not to appear in the list shown in the CMS.

![findCollection1](https://images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/1DM1TNjCKYsY0KQkMgycGm/c49a70d5570d62c993539114d8596549/findCollection1.png)

But you can fetch any collection using the __search field__ (Find), including those that are not displayed by default.

![findCollection2](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/6LBUTpvCH64Uc2CQEwiigk/5739b97f92b27ec9fc40fb4e93ffb2af/findCollection2.png)
