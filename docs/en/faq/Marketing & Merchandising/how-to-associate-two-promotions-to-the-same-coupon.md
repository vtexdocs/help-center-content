When necessary, you can create a discount [coupon](/tutorial/creating-a-coupon?locale=en) with the same amount of the total purchase. With this, the customer can make a new order without paying anything more for it.

The most common is that this value is relative to two amounts: the product's nominal price and the shipping.

Because of this, you need to create two [regular promotions](/tutorial/regular-promotion?locale=en) related to the same coupon:

- A free shipping benefit.
- A nominal value discount benefit.

Check below how to perform this process:

1. Access __Promotions & Taxes__.
2. Click __Promotions__.
3. Click the first regular promotion you want to set up.
4. Proceed to the __What are the conditions for the benefit to be valid?__ section.
5. Enter the coupon code in __utm_source__.

6. Click 'Create coupon from UTMs above'.
7. Click 'Save'.
8. Return to the __Promotions__ panel.
9. Repeat the process with the second regular promotion.
10. In the end, both promotions must present the same UTM.

With this, the customer can get a full discount of both values before closing the purchase.
