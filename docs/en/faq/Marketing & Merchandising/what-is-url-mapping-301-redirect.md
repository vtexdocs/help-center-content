URL mapping is used for redirecting specific URLs to other URLs. This tool is very useful when a store already has URLs indexed in search engines and wants to redirect them to more attractive ones, without changing the SEO and avoiding errors of indexation.

All mapping activities recorded will be executed within the 301 type. The 301 redirect, also known as “permanent redirect,” transfers all key data from your original URL (PageRank, Popularity of Links etc) to the new URL.

URL mapping is recorded in the Portal Manager. In the “E-Commerce” module, go to the menu “Configurações &gt; Portal”:
