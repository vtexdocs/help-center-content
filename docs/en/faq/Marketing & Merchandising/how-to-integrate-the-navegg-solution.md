Navegg is a company of the Buscapé group totally devoted to the online audience segment. Through analysis of browsing behaviors, its solutions create audience segments that are prepared to receive customized contents and advertising anywhere on the web.

Prior to integrating Navegg to the VTEX platform, you must set up Google Tag Manager in accordance with the steps described in the article [Integration with Google Tag Manager](/hc/pt-br/articles/204902998 "Integration with Google Tag Manager").
Then, just enter the Navegg tag on Google Tag Manager according to the steps below:
**Attention:** entering the Navegg tag on Google Tag Manager has some peculiarities and details that must be respected for the integration to be successful. Observe the following guidance carefully.

1. You must use the entire Navegg tag, according to the example below:

`
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var nvgId = "ID_NAVEGG";
var nvgAsync = false;
(function() {
var nvg = document.createElement('script');
nvg.id="navegg";
nvg.type = 'text/javascript';
nvg.async = nvgAsync;
nvg.src = document.location.protocol+'//tag.navdmp.com/tm'+nvgId+'.js';
var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
s.parentNode.insertBefore(nvg, s);
})();
&lt;/script&gt;`

* The `ID NAVEGG` indicated on the tag is unique to your account, being informed upon your registration with Navegg. Additionally, it is always available on the settings of the control panel.

3. Click on the **New tag** button and fill out the information requested on each field, according to the example below;
