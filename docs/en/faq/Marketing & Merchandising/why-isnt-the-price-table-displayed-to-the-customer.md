It is possible that in some cases the store admin sets up the Price Table and its prices are not displayed to the customers.

Follow the steps below in the Admin to check if the set up was done correctly.

1. Access the __Catalog__.
2. Click __Products and SKUs__.
3. Verify that the product in question is __Active__ and set to be displayed on the website.

After this initial verification, proceed as follows:
1. Click on __Master Data__, in the Admin sidebar.
2. Click to view the list of __Customers__ records in the application __Profile System__.
3. Look for the __client__ in question.
4. Check if the __Price Table__ field in the record is filled with the desired price table value.

Finally, return to the initial panel and follow the steps below.
1. Access __Prices__.
2. Click __Price List__.
3. Click __Edit Filter__.
4. In __Trade Policy__, select the proper __price table__.
5. Search for the desired __SKU__.
6. Confirm that the __price table__ has the price registered.
