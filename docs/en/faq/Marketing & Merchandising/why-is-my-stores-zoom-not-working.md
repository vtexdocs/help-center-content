Before anything else, check whether the zoom is correctly set up in your store. To do this, read the article [Setting up the zoom](/en/faq/how-to-set-up-the-zoom).

Everything is correct and the zoom is still not displaying? Or it only appears for some images?

**By default, the sizes of all images need to be equal to or greater than 1000x1000 pixels for the zoom to be enabled.**

This image size can be set up through the following steps:
1. Click __CMS__ in the Admin menu.
2. Enter Settings.
3. Click __File Types__ tab.

![Tipos de Arquivo EN](//images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/3vFG4pv5Wgkcu6GaIEgOAa/17ee2d04db1d1dce4237de9bfaf6cc9e/Tipos_de_Arquivo_EN.png)

The 1000x1000 size means that the resulting zoom will display the image in that size. Thus, this is the minimum size for the zoom to work.

### Example

I uploaded a 1200×1200 image. On my product page, it appears as 600×600 and, when I move the mouse over it, the zoom amplifies it to 1000×1000.

Now, let’s say I have no image 1000x1000 in size, rather only 800×800. I can set up the “Produto – Zoom” in “Tipos de arquivos” to 800×800. On my product page, my image appears as 600×600, and when I move the mouse over it, the zoom amplifies it to 800×800. In this case, the amplification will be smaller because of the settings of the “Produto– Zoom” size.
