It's not possible to generate a report. VTEX doesn't have a native tool prepared for that, but you may probably get this information from the ERP used by your store.

However, you can obtain this result by doing an analysis on the orders spreadsheet available in the OMS module.

__To access this spreadsheet, follow the steps below:__

1. Access the __OMS__ module.
2. Click the __Filter__ icon.
3. Do a search __by period__ (remembering that the maximum allowed range is up to 6 months. In case you want to search for a period of 1 year, for example, search twice).
4. When returning to the filtered list of orders, __click the export icon__.![exportacaoOMS](https://images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/3pX1xFqvS0uMOEe8OUquci/81e2be7c1948d62a863cfccfc36f18a9/exportacaoOMS.png)
5. A progress bar will appear. So, to finish, you need to click __Export xxx orders to e-mail__.![ExportarOMS](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/3Z7h82etgIuQcUI6iGsgyk/11bbadc4b3c2174c82844e9125af8e50/ExportarOMS.png)

Your request will enter a queue, which can be followed through the OMS. When your turn arrives, you will receive the orders spreadsheet in your email.

To get the information about your best selling products, after downloading the spreadsheet, you must make the account between the columns __AH (Quantity_SKU) __, which says the amount of SKU that was sold, and the column __AI (ID_SKU) __, which refers to the SKU in question.

>❗ Exports can be made within a 31-day time frame.
