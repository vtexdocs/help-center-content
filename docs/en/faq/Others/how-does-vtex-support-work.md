At VTEX, we share the responsibility of our clients' success. Our support plans give you access to the best level of assistance and expertise to use the platform better and develop your business. You can mitigate risks associated with your digital operation and keep operational costs under control. 

## Support

All clients have access to the services provided by our Support team. These specialists are extensively prepared to give you the best experience possible when solving your tickets. To contact them, you need to [open a ticket to VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/abrir-chamados-para-o-suporte-vtex--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM?locale=pt).

### Ticket System

The official communications channel with the Support team is established through the ticket system. To open a ticket, access the Help Center homepage and click on the **Support** option in the top bar.  

The moment you open a ticket, it is directed to the support team responsible for that store, team which will respond as soon as possible. Clients receive their ticket replies by email. 

While waiting for your ticket to be solved, you may follow its status using [the support panel](https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests). When a ticket is marked as solved, you will receive a feedback email to indicate your level of satisfaction and include any comments related to our service.

### Support Plans

To better serve global customers in different countries, our Customer Excellence team works independently by region. Each region has the autonomy to define its team organization, availability, service SLA and additional support resources:

- Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- [Brazil](/pt/faq/suporte-vtex-brasil--5q861sTw1n7H2BENOu7ls9)
- [United States (USA)](/en/faq/vtex-support-united-states--Bm45YFp68QRe1Z5r2oa07)

- Latin America (LATAM, ex. Brasil)

### Satisfaction Survey

The *Satisfaction Survey* page in your VTEX Admin allows you to view a list of resolved tickets submitted by you on behalf of your store. Through the page you can also rate VTEX's support through our Satisfaction Survey page after each ticket is resolved.    

To access it, go to **Account settings** and click on **Satisfaction survey**.
