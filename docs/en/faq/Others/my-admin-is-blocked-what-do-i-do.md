The Admin locking usually occurs due to overdue invoices. To unlock, you must open a [ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) by selecting the title Admin Locked in the subject field, and the Financial team will contact you to start the unlocking procedure. 

## Temporary Unlocking Admin

While waiting for the Finance team to contact you, you can temporarily unlock the Admin for a period of 2 working days - 48 hours.

Follow the steps below in order to unlock your Admin for this period of time. You must have the permissions of Admin Super or [Financial Role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-criar-um-perfil-de-acesso-financeiro--717qPtxW3Cy9n5KrReHeVv?locale=en) to perform the following actions:

1. Access the Invoices module.
2. Click **Check how to temporarily unlock**.
3. Enter the ticket number you previously opened to unlock.
4. Click the **Unlock for 48 hours** button.
