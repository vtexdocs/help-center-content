VTEX uses the Post Office base for uploading addresses linked to postal codes on Smart Checkout. However, VTEX maps this data internally. Therefore it may occur that the address of a postal code is up to date at the Post Office and out of date on VTEX.

In such cases, it is necessary to contact VTEX through our customer service channels so as to update the address.
