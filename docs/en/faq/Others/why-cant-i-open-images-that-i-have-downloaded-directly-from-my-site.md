Due to the [compacting of images to WebP](/en/tutorial/how-the-automatic-compacting-of-images-works), there may be difficulty in opening files saved directly from the store. This happens because the operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) are not natively compatible with this format.

Even if the name of the file is something like "banner.jpg", this does not mean that it is an image in JPG format, since the browser does not use the file extension to indicate format, but rather its content.

### Recovering images in the original format

Currently, the best way to recover an image in JPG or PNG without it being converted to WebP is to save the file using Firefox, since this browser is not compatible with the format – there is no conversion.

In Google Chrome, which is compatible, all images (except GIF) will be supplied in WebP.

### Opening WebP images

You can open images in WebP on your computer using compatible programs or installing a codec for WebP.

On the Google page [support for 
WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download), we can find libraries for various purposes, including a [codec for Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/WebpCodecSetup.exe). Installing it is enough to allow you to open them with the Windows image viewer and to see their miniatures in the folder.

For Photoshop, you can use the plug-in created by [Telegraphics](http://telegraphics.com.au/sw/product/webpformat).
