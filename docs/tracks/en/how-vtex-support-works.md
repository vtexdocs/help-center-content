VTEX Support is provided online and allows you to open tickets with different priority levels, depending on your store location. Tickets can be opened on the [support page](https://help.vtex.com/en/support), which requires [user account authentication](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/4EPwTXx5oFdSG1dA3zIchz#setting-roles-and-permissions-for-users). Three authentication methods are available:

- Token received via the email added to the store.
- Login using a Google account.
- Email and password with two-factor authentication via app or SMS.
