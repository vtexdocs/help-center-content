One of the first things you need to do on your website is to _link it to an account name_. This process is called **binding**.

**Website binding** bridges the gap between CMS and the information defined in the accounts and permissions module. It states that an **account name** (configured in the accounts module) is linked to the folder and file structure of a particular **Website** (built in CMS).

To link it, check out our [article about linking an account name to a website.](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/linking-an-account-name-to-a-website-binding--PxjfleOw6suCSO2uGWMMs)

The configuration shown above is for when you want an account to have more than one store.

**Multi-store** or multi-domain is a resource used to manage more than one store within the same VTEX admin panel.

This feature is usually used when a store has more than one brand but they all have  similar logistics and payment methods, or when the store needs another environment, for example for B2B sales.

A **binding** is made for each store in the **Multi-store** option. Check out our [article on multi-store and multi-domain](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/creating-multi-store-multi-domain--tutorials_510) to configure this option.
