On VTEX Intelligent Search, you can **Detach SKUs by specification**. This feature allows the store to determine the SKUs that will be displayed in search results.

Previously, products were displayed in the search result without any distinction between them. So it was necessary to add each SKU as a single product for them to be displayed separately in the search result.

Now this kind of workaround in the Catalog is no longer necessary. You can [configure the SKU specifications](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/5t75L6lYNwix93l41s1Yrx) you want to display in the search directly in the Admin.

This tool is useful for clothing stores as it allows you to display the products by color or material.

See the following example of detaching SKUs by color. In the image below, the featured sandals are available in two different colors in the search results:

<div class="alert alert-info"><p>
If search results are sorted by relevance, the SKUs of a given product will be grouped together. In other words, they will be displayed side by side.</p></div>

## Configuration
To configure which attributes will be used to detach SKUs, see our [Search Settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/5t75L6lYNwix93l41s1Yrx#) article.
