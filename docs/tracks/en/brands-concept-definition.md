## Definition

Brands are **Product** attributes of your store, in the same way that *Description* and *Name* are also considered to be product attributes or product properties. 

When associating a brand to your products, you will be able to use this attribute as a filter when browsing your store. It's fairly common for customers to search for products using a brand as keyword.

At VTEX, you need to create brands **independently**, meaning that once you create a product in your store, it should be associated with a previously created brand.
