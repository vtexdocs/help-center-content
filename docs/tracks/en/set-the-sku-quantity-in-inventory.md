You already have a product associated with a category and a brand, have a SKU for it, an image and a price. In order for this SKU to be available to be purchased by customers in your store, you just need to tell the system the number of units of this SKU in your inventory. After all, if there is no stock, it can not be sold.

To register the stock, follow the steps below.
1. In the __Catalog__ module, hover over __Products Management__, go to __Products and SKUs__ and click the __Products and SKUs Management__ option.
2. In the line of the SKU you want, click on the truck symbol (you will be taken to the Logistics module).![SKUstock](https://images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/5HArBLp1qoq6cyUk8Oc8mO/473c1415e082ee2c644f5ab95f24ff73/SKUstock.png)

You will see a table with information about:
- The SKU whose stock you are editing.
- The SKU quantities for each of your inventories (it is likely that for now you have only 1 inventory).

In the __Update count__ column, enter the number of items for this SKU. Then click __Save__.

Your SKU now has stock and is available to your customers.
