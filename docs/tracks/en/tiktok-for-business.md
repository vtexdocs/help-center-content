[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) is an entertainment platform for creating and sharing short videos that offers marketing tools for businesses. One of the key tools available in this context is TikTok Ads Manager, which contains advanced features for launching campaigns and managing advertising on TikTok.

With the integration between VTEX and TikTok, you can use TikTok as another sales channel and for product advertisements in a connected way between these tools.

To configure this integration in your store, VTEX has developed the free [TikTok for Business app](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexbr-tiktok-tbp/p), available on [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/).

The app allows you to:

* Connect TikTok for Business and TikTok Ads Manager accounts with your VTEX account.
* Sync your product catalog with TikTok.
* Install [TikTok Pixel](#tiktok-pixel) in your VTEX store.
* Manage your ads on TikTok from the VTEX Admin.

## TikTok Pixel

TikTok Pixel is a JavaScript code you can include on your store's website to share your visitors' actions with TikTok. It tracks the following visitor actions:

* View a page from your store.
* Add one or more products to the shopping cart.
* Make a purchase.

In VTEX IO stores, by installing and configuring TikTok for Business, TikTok Pixel will automatically be installed. In stores using Legacy or Headless CMS, you need to configure it manually, following the [TikTok documentation](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000357) to insert the code using Google Tag Manager.
