Once the payment condition has been created, you must create the filters that define which payment methods will appear in the VTEX Sales App checkout.

To do this, your store developers must customize a JavaScript file. For more information, please refer to the guide [Define payment methods displayed on VTEX Sales App](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/define-payment-methods-displayed-on-instore).

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<p>To enable payment conditions via the VTEX Sales App app, you must make changes to a JavaScript file. This operation must only be performed by people with programming experience. Incorrect changes to this file can cause critical errors.</p>
</div>
