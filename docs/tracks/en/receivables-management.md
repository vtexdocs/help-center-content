VTEX Platform allows for a full overview on business transactions, where stores can check receivables, follow disputed transactions and anticipate payments.

Everything is aligned with the VTEX Admin user experience stores are already used to.

## Dispute management

In an e-commerce scenario, disputes are a reality that needs to be handled. VTEX Payment platform also allows stores to follow all dispute processes in the "Disputes" section.

Although it is a single process, stores need to properly manage disputes in these two recurring scenarios: 

- __Paid order__: when payment was already made, the money remains in the store’s VTEX Payment digital account. A chargeback is only applicable when a store loses a dispute.  
- __Unpaid order__: clients begin the dispute process before payment is done. In this case, the amount is transferred only if the store wins the dispute.

Regardless of the situation, a dispute must be answered within ten days.

## Methods of payment

Each store has its own reality, therefore VTEX Payment offers stores three ways to receive payment.

The main difference among VTEX Payment plans is the receiving of credit card payments.

There are three possibilities: 

- __Receive in 30 days__: option that allows stores to receive the total transaction amount in 30 days.

- __Receive in 14 days__: payments are transferred every 14 days. The transaction fees are slightly more expensive than the 30 days plan, due to the faster payment transfer time. 

- __Receive in installments__: the scenario here is a very simple one in which stores receive payment according to the flow agreed for each transaction. A purchase of U$ 100,00 may be split into 10 installments for example, where the store receives U$10,00 every 30 days for the next 10 months. 

## Anticipation of payments receivable

One of the acquirer services offered by VTEX Payment is the anticipation of payments receivable. 

Put into practice, if a store wants to receive the total amount from a purchase when the transaction is captured, or anticipate the total payments receivable, it can request this on the platform, subject to an advance fee.

By doing so, stores can better manage their cash flow during periods of low income, for example.
