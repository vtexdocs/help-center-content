Once successfully installed, you can set up a campaign.

In this app, we share the Smart Shopping Campaign, Google's latest powerful tool for creating shopping campaigns ([learn more about it here!](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7457632)) Its configuration is very easy; and that is precisely the goal: to empower our customers to the maximum and in the simplest way possible!

Follow this step-by-step to set it up:

1. In the upper right corner, click __"Campaign Audiences"__.
2. Click the __"Create New Campaign"__ button.
3. Fill in the campaign form to set your parameters:
 - __Name:__ choose a name for your campaign (for internal control only);
 - __Budget:__ set an average daily budget that you want to invest;
 - __Bids:__ bids are how you pay for users' interaction with your ads. With a sufficient bid and good quality product data, your ad will be ranked higher in ad auctions.
    <br/>&bull; __Bidding strategy:__ in this type of campaign the only bidding strategy is to "Maximize the value of the conversion", precisely because the goal is to deliver the highest possible financial return on the investment made, not a greater number of conversions or clicks.
    <br/>&bull; __Set a desired Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS):__ When marking this flag you must define which ROAS the campaign should pursue.
     <br/>_`Ex:` If you set a 800% ROAS, it means that for every $ 1.00 spent on the campaign it should convert $ 8.00._

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note: We do not recommend setting up a ROAS</strong> as soon as you start a campaign for the first time. This is because the campaign needs some time before it learns how to deliver products on the search, which can take up to 4 weeks, according to Google. So until it's mature it is advisable not to set up a ROAS.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note 2:</strong> We also recommend that the <strong>campaign setting is not changed</strong> during the first 4 weeks, precisely because of the time the artificial intelligence needs to complete its initial learning process.
</div>

*__That's all!__ You now have your campaign set up and within a few days you should start seeing results in the app dashboard.*
