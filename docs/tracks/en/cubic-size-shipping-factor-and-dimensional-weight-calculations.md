## Cubic size

The cubic size is the relationship between the __volume__ and __weight__ of goods shipped by the store.

It is important in a logistics context because it influences the carrier's capacity to ship. The bigger the volume and/or the weight, the greater tha cubic size, and therefore the more restrictive the shipping conditions.

The cubic size's function in shipping is to avoid a vehicle's physical space being taken up disproportionately to the weight used, and also vice-versa, avoiding the vehicle's weight carrying limit is surpassed without having used all of its physical storage space.

## DIM weight

The dimensional weight (also called DIM weight) is calculated by determining the cubic size of a package and determines the most commercially viable relationship between volume and weight for the carrier.

It can be bigger or smaller than the package's net weight.

## Shipping factor

The shipping factor is the __carrier provided coefficient__ used to calculate the DIM weight.

It's used in the DIM weight equation as follows:
>  length x width x height x shipping factor

Example:

- Package dimensions: 50cm x 60cm x 15cm 
- Package net weight: 9kg 
- Shipping factor: 0,167
- DIM Weight = `50cm * 60cm * 15cm * 0,167` = __7,5kg__ 

For the example above, when comparing the package's net weight with its DIM weight, the carrier will charge for the real weight, since it's more than the DIM weight.

Check your carrier's measurement unit, to see whether it's in grams and centimeters or pounds and inches.

When adding your carrier, this is the value that you need to fill into the Shipping Factor field.
