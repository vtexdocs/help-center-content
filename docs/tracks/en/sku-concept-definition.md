## Definition

SKU stands for "Stock Keeping Unit", meaning the items that are effectively in your inventory. 

At VTEX, SKUs are hierarchically under __Product__. 

## SKUs and Specifications

A __Specification__ is a SKU characteristic ascertaining to the difference of that SKU from other SKUs linked to the same product.

Further on this track, we'll go into more details on how to add SKU's Specifications. For now, it's important to know that SKUs differ by their Specifications.

## Examples 

### Fashion 

Let's say for example that your shop sells T-shirt. 

The T-shirts represent your __products__, however, your customers will in fact purchase the various __types__ of T-shirts that your store offers.

A customer will not just shop for a "T-shirt", in fact, the __physical product__ sent to the customer’s address will be a "red medium size T-shirt", for example. 

T-shirt size and color are, in this case, product __Specifications__. The __size__ specification values available are "S", "M", and "L". The __color__ specification values are "blue", "red", and "yellow".

### Home Appliances

We will now analyze a home appliances store use case. One of the most common __departments__ in such a store is related to "kitchen utensils", with one of the __categories__ of this department being "microwave ovens".

There are, of course, several __types__ of microwave ovens. 

You may choose a __Microwave with an Integrated Control Panel__, either with a __127V__ or a __220V__ voltage option. We can safely say that the __voltage__ options is, in this case, the specification that differ the SKUs of the "Microwave with an Integrated Control Panel" product. 

### Home Décor

Lastly, we’ll look at a store specialized in home décor.

The idea is the same: let’s say that you are buying an orthopedic mattress.

You will need to access the "Mattress" __department__, followed by the "Orthopedic" __category__. 

Imagine that you choose a product called "Continental Sleep mattress", but it comes in different **sizes**. 

The SKUs in this case are "Continental Sleep Mattress - Twin size", "Continental Sleep Mattress - Queen size", "Continental Sleep Mattress - King size", while the product is the "Continental Sleep Mattress".
