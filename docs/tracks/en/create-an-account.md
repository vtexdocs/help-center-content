After hiring VTEX, the store receives its account. This account identifies the store ownership and allows for high-level configurations.

To develop apps using VTEX IO, you must first have access to a store account. 

>ℹ️ Every app created with VTEX IO is developed in the context of a VTEX account.

If you don't have access to any account yet and need to create one, contact VTEX sales team and then read the article on how to [link your account name to a website](/en/tutorial/linking-an-account-name-to-a-website-binding).
