Any SKU in your store needs a price to be displayed to the end user.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Even an SKU that will be offered as a gift needs to have a price.
</div>

To register the price, follow the steps below.
1. In the __Catalog__ module, hover over __Products Management__ tab, go to __Products and SKUs__ and click the __Products and SKUs Management__ option.
2. In the line of the SKU you want, click the dollar sign (you will be taken to the Pricing module).
3. In the SKU column, click the cell with the name of the SKU.

In the sidebar that appears on the left, you'll see some pricing information to fill out. The most important are:
- __Price cost__: How much this SKU costs for your store.
- __Initial Markup__: The profit rate you want from this product.

By filling in these two values, the system will automatically give you the __base price__ of the product.

Now all you have to do is set the stock of this SKU so that it becomes available to your customers.
