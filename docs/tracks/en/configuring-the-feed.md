Feeds are lists of products that will be advertised through Google Merchant Center. There are two types of feeds:
- **Main feed:** the most important source of information about your products.
- **Complementary feed:** updates specific data in one or more main feeds.

For using the integration with Google Shopping, it is crucial to **set the VTEX feed as your primary feed on Google Merchant Center**, as it includes your most relevant product data. This happens automatically when the integration is completed; just make sure you do not change this setting.

Using **a complementary feed is optional.** However, we recommend it in some cases, for example when you have to add information that is not automatically sent by the integration.

>Example: when you have to specify whether a product is new or used.

Creating a complementary feed can also be beneficial when you want to change information about a product in Google Shopping but **do not want to change your trade policy.**
