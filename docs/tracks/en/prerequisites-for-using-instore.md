This article explains all the requirements that a VTEX account needs to meet before you can configure, install and start using VTEX Sales App:

- [Equipment](#equipment)
- [Partners](#partners)
- [Use cases](#use-cases)
    - [Endless aisle](#endless-aisle)
    - [Store pickup and Ship from Store](#store-pickup-and-ship-from-store)
    - [VTEX Sales App integrated with POS](#instore-integrated-with-pos)

## Equipment

To maintain the equipment and the smooth running of your operation, it is important to have more devices than sellers. This way, the devices can be quickly replaced in case of battery failure, damage, or depletion. We recommend reserving a secure space in your store to store and recharge the equipment.

### Tablets, smartphones and computers

The VTEX Sales App app works on tablets and smartphones using **Android 6.0** (or newer) and **iOS 9** (or newer) operating systems.

Some examples of devices that can be used:

* Samsung Galaxy Tab A Note
* Motorola G4
* Samsung S8

We recommend that the devices used to access VTEX Sales App have 4G chips for internet access. This way, your store will continue to function normally even if there are problems with the Wi-Fi network.

VTEX Sales App also works on computers that use the **Windows** operating system, provided that the following minimum requirements are met:

- **Windows 8** (or newer)
- **Intel i3+** (or newer) or **AMD Phenom II X4** (or newer)
- 4GB RAM (or more)
- 120GB HD/SSD (or more)

To learn how to install the VTEX Sales App app, please visit our[ Installation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-usando-o-app--4BYzQIwyOHvnmnCYQgLzdr/2rPSJ8519UCCZo5uEBkqxh) guide.

### Internet

An internet connection is essential for VTEX VTEX Sales App to work, as it is through the internet that the communication between the application, VTEX and the partners takes place.

The minimum internet requirements are:

- Router with standard 2.4Ghz connection (802.11 N) and device to router connection of 20 Mbps.
- Internet with link speed of 2 Mbps (reaching the device, i.e., what is shown in the speed test on the mobile phone).

Additional recommendations:

- Router with standard 5.0Ghz 802.11 AC connection (the mobile phone must be dual-band) and device to router connection of 40 Mbps.
- Internet with link speed of 5 Mbps (reaching the device, i.e., what is shown in the speed test on the mobile phone).

### Barcode scanner

With VTEX Sales App, you can scan the barcode of your products using the camera of your tablet or smartphone, although they do not work as well as devices that specialize in this function.

It is essential that you register the barcode of each item in your Catalog, following the steps in the guide [Registering SKU barcodes for VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-primeiros-passos-e-configuracoes--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/4eooWH0d8Aiwzparyi4Hg).

We recommend using a dedicated barcode scanner if your store often receives orders for multiple items and if you consider it important to have more speed and accuracy at checkout. You can choose any barcode scanner to scan products in VTEX Sales App. An example of a barcode scanner is Honeywell Solaris MK7820. 

### Credit card terminals

Credit card terminals (using Bluetooth or USB) are offered by payment partners (acquirers or sub-acquirers), who will process the payments in your physical store. You can see a list in the [Partners](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/instore-primeiros-passos-e-configuracoes--zav76TFEZlAjnyBVL5tRc/1wtAanSRA3g2316dw7bw8u) section of this tutorial.

### Thermal printer

To print electronic invoices and credit card receipts, you will need a non-fiscal thermal printer. Some of the recommended models are:

- EPSON T20 USB
- EPSON TM-M30
- ELGIN I9 USB

## Partners

VTEX has several partners who enable the operation of physical stores. Each partner has a specific role in ensuring that the entire sales process works safely.

VTEX has a standard contract with these partners to facilitate the implementation of your products, but you must better terms directly with them.

### Payments

To configure the acquirer that will process your store payments, go to [Configuring Payment Methods for VTEX Sales App](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/instore-pagamentos--43B4Nr7uZva5UdwWEt3PEy).

### Invoicing

To issue the invoice to the consumer, VTEX has integrations with ERP and other systems responsible for this part of the process. You can learn more about this functionality by referring to the [Electronic invoice integration guide](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/guia-de-integracao-do-gerenciamento-de-pedidos-com-cf-e-para-o-vtex-instore--51xsyWzGiQ08KMO2EaaGAa).

The invoicing partners we recommend are:

* [e-Millennium](https://e-millennium.com.br/)
* [Webbsys](http://www.webbsys.com.br/site/)

You can contact [VTEX support](https://support.vtex.com/hc/pt-br/requests) for more information about our partners.

## Use cases

Below are the prerequisites and recommendations for the main use cases of VTEX Sales App in your [unified commerce](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/2LGAiUnHES1enjHsfi8fI3) strategy.

### Endless aisle

The [endless aisle](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/40KMlmGI5tN0r0KPCDWgGn) is the resource that allows your customers to access your entire inventory, integrated across all channels. With this, if a customer is in a physical store, they can buy a product from the inventory of other stores or even from your ecommerce.

For more information, see our guide on the [endless aisle](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/40KMlmGI5tN0r0KPCDWgGn).

The prerequisites for implementing the endless aisle are all the items described in the previous topics.

### Ship from Store and pickup points

[Ship from Store](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/50GAmxxFsJoLWqcnMysWdl) turns your physical stores into small distribution centers. With this feature, you can ship products from the inventory of a store, even if they were not purchased there.

[Pickup points](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/4hXfgqXxS1lwAfnxgja3xW) are places where the customer has the option to pick up their own orders. The physical stores in your chain, for example, can function as pickup points.

The prerequisites for implementing these strategies are all the items described in the previous topics.

Additional recommendations:

- Activating the **Checkout v6** module. Please refer to the article[ Activating Checkout v6](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/ativar-o-checkout-v6--7qVqv3ptRvpVVplrvg8ruH) for more information.
- Pricing: we recommend that your physical stores inherit the prices from your ecommerce. However, if you decide to have different prices, please consider the requirements and remarks below.
    - It is necessary to involve a partner agency to regionalize the catalog.
    - This may affect price comparison tools, as they only receive one price.
    - This may affect sales on marketplaces, as they also receive only one price.
    - We recommend hiring the VTEX Professional Services team to customize your architecture and enable price differentiation.

### VTEX Sales App integrated with POS

This feature allows you to [integrate VTEX Sales App with the points of sale](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/estrategias-de-comercio-unificado--3WGDRRhc3vf1MJb9zGncnv/4hXfgqXxS1lwAfnxgja3xW) of your physical stores.

Prerequisites for implementing the integration between VTEX Sales App and POS:

- All the prerequisites described above, including those for [endless aisle](#endless-aisle), [Ship from Store and pickup points](#ship-from-store-and-pickup-points).
- Integration with an invoicing system, as described in [Invoicing](#invoicing).
