Currently, the payment split option does not apply to the following two scenarios.

## Payment methods
Currently, the payment split option cannot be enabled for the following payment methods:  

- Commercial papers 
- Private Labels 
- Cobranded
- Gift Card

## Multiple payment methods 
For orders paid using more than one payment method, the payment split option will only apply if all payment methods support the feature.   

For example, an order split between credit card and gift card cannot use the payment split.
