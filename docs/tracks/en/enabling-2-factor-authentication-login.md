With two-step verification (also known as two-factor authentication or 2FA), you add an extra layer of security to your account to protect it if your password is revealed to a third party.

After enabling the 2FA, you will make your store login using:

- Your password (*something you know*)
- Your phone number (*something you own*)

Your phone will generate a short key at the moment of login. Thus, it becomes almost impossible that someone unauthorized accesses your store using your information.

## How to enable the 2FA

We always request the two-step verification setup, in case it is not enabled when users log in using their email and password.

There are two authentication options:

- __App Google__ (key generated by an authentication app)
- __SMS Message__ (key sent by text message)

>⚠️ We recommend you to use a[authentication application](#enabling-2fa-por-aplicativo) to prevent failures in your telephone provider from making your login impossible. Though the app, the access key will always be available for use.

>ℹ️ As some companies restrict the use of cell phones by telesales operators, users with the [ telesales role](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tutorial/perfis-de-acesso--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#call-center-operator" target="_blank) do not have to enable the 2FA when logging in with email and password.

## Enabling the 2FA through an app

To use a key generated by authentication application:

1. Download the application **Google Authenticator** ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) / [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=pt_BR)).

2. Use the application to read the QR Code with your phone's camera.

3. Your VTEX account will be added to the application, with a 6-digit code. Enter the code to finish your login.

  *The app code is regularly updated. It will not be necessary to memorize it, go to the application whenever you need it.*

>ℹ️ If you log in using your email and password on the same computer, you will be asked for your access key every 3 days. When this happens, check the code in the application..

## Enabling 2FA via SMS

To use a key sent by text message:

1. enter your phone number to receive the code by SMS - don't forget to enter your country and area code.

2. You will receive a text message from VTEX on the indicated phone. Enter the 6-digit key to finish your login.

 >⚠️ We cannot guarantee that your telephone company will be able to deliver the access key whenever necessary. If the VTEX text message does not arrive, try resending the code or <a href="#enabling-2fa-through-an-app" >enable the 2FA per-application</a>.
