## Definition

VTEX architecture recognizes **Product** as the catalog organization level above that of *SKUs*, but under that of *Categories*.

Since the product is hierarchically above the SKU in catalog hierarchy, we can perceive it as a generic definition of items sold in your store.

SKUs, as the last organization level of a catalog, are the items that end users actually buy.

SKUs are Product variations, placing the Product on a more abstract level to what is being sold in the store.

## Examples

Let's use the example of a Fashion store. This store's catalog can have a product called *men's printed T-shirt*. The customer needs to choose a size for the T-shirt in order to be able to buy it. Therefore, the product may have the following SKUs linked to it:

- Men's printed T-shirt - Size S
- Men's printed T-shirt - Size M
- Men's printed T-shirt - Size L

The Product is what is *on offer* in the store's display window. The store usually does not show specific details, such as size, for products on display. What is being *sold* is a "Men's Printed T-shirt", but what the customer actually *buys* is a "men's printed T-shirt, size M".

Understanding the concept of product directly influences the display strategy of items in the store's display window. Products are displayed in a store's display window, whereas SKUs are selected by the customer inside the product page.
