As explained before, your store writes the page codes in the CMS __templates__. When the store gains access to Admin, for example, the `Home` template is the one that contains the code of the site's *homepage*.

But let's say you create a new `Home2` template and want to display it on the homepage. How does the platform know that it is the `Home2` template that should be shown on the homepage, not the `Home` template?

To indicate this, you need to associate the desired template with the __layout__, which is in the site folder structure within Sites and Channels.

This association is made in the layout properties setting. To get there, follow these steps:

1. Click on __Sites and channels__.
2. Click on the website of the store you are editing.
3. Click on the root folder ("/").
4. Search for the layout you want to edit.
5. Click on the __Template__ drop-down. There will be listed the templates configured in HTML Templates.
6. Select the template you want to associate with this layout.
7. Type "yes" to confirm the change (this step is necessary because this is a critical change for the site, as the page's front-end will be replaced).
