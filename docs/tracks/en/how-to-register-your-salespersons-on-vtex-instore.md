### How to register a salesperson

Registering a salesperson will let the app associate the person identified with a given store. So, when identifying a salesperson, the app will be able to:

1. Identify the sales made by that person for reporting purposes;
2. Load the prices, payment conditions and product availability regarding the store in which the salesperson operates.

The salesperson identification is obtained as shown in the image below:
