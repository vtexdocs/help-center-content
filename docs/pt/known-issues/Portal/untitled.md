## Sumário


There are some stores without all the StoreText Available to be edited on the `/admin/Site/TextoSite.aspx`:


## Simulação


This problem happens in not every store, it has to be checked if all the Store text is available on the URL `/admin/Site/TextoSite.aspx`.


## Workaround


Ask the Support Team by a ticket to add the remaining Store Texts.
