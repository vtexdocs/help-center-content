## Summary



When the account setups two gift promotions to accumulate on the cart the result is not the one expected by the client. Instead of giving the two gifts as a benefit, only one is being applied to the cartlink and is not the most expensive.


##

## Simulation



1. Create two gift promotions and check them to allow accumulate (the gifts must be different)
2. Create a cart scenario where both promotions should apply.
3. Check that only one gift is appearing on the cart (and it can be not the most expensive one)


##

## Workaround


No workaround.
