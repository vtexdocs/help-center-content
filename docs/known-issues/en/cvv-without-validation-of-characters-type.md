## Summary


At checkout, we ask for credit card information and we only allow the customer to type numbers in the Card Number field, only letters in the Card Owner Name field. However, we do not do a similar validation for the CVV field, allowing the customer to type letters in this field



## Simulation


Go to any stores checkout  and you can fill letters in the CVV field for the payment method credit card



## Workaround


N/A
