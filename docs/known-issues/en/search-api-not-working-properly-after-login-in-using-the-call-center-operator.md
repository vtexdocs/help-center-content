## Summary


Search API not working properly after login in using the Call Center Operator.



## Simulation


After login in the store with the Call Center Operator, just log in some costumer account and try to make a search.

The search will return nothing.

If you are not logged in with the Call Center Operator, it will work properly.



## Workaround


The Call center operator can still navigate in the store to find the products but he is not able to use the search function
