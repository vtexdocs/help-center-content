The IAM team proudly launched a new feature today, the 2-factor authentication at the admins of the stores. The 2-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process in which the user provides two authentication factors to verify if they are who they say they are. The two distinct ways used are user/password and phone message.
This means that the users who try to login in the admins now *have the option* to activate the feature in his account or keep logging as usual only with user and password.
The objecte of the team is in the future make the use of the feature mandatory to all users of the admins.
